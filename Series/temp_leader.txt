	% A leader will offer a combat mission. Yay! So what's different
	% between this one and the regular combat template? Well, first of
	% all this one isn't linked to a story, so it's good for making
	% independant PLOT_*.txt missions. Secondly, some of the things have
	% been rebalanced so a deserving PC will get the mission more easily
	% while an undeserving one won't. Leaders generally like Heroic, Lawful
	% types.

	% Element1 is just the leader of some town.
