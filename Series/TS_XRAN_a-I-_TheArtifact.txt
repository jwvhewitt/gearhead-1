	Msg1 <I can't believe what happened to Professor \ELEMENT 4 ... Who would do such a thing?>
	Msg2 <It's been all over the news. Some thieves killed the professor and ransacked \PPR E4 office. It doesn't make sense. We haven't discovered anything valuable in the ruins; there's probably nothing valuable there.>
	Msg3 <\ELEMENT 4 was a great researcher. It makes no sense that \SPR E4 was killed... The ruin we're exploring is a cultural dig site. We haven't discovered anything valuable; there's probably nothing valuable there.>

	Msg3 <That's really disappointing. Since you left, an archivist from Hwang-Sa temple has been asking about the ruin. If you had found anything, they might have been interested in financing further exploration.>

	Msg2 <I get the feeling that you're in denial, either to yourself or just to me. Come back sometime when you are ready for some knowledge.>
	Msg3 <Ah, so you have it! This is a great relief to me; I had feared the worst. Here, you should be properly rewarded for recovering this gem.>
	Msg4 <You left the Emerald somewhere unguarded? Hurry, go retrieve it... It is very important that it not fall into the wrong hands!>
