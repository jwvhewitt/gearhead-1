	Msg16 <You are intruding in our defense zone. Identify yourself or we'll open fire.>
	Msg17 <It's company policy to attack unidentified mecha which stray too close to our convoy. There's a lot of bandits out there and we have to be careful, you know.>

	Msg30 <Guards, attack this moron!>

	Msg31 <I don't have time to be slowed down by a petty criminal like yourself. Tell you what... I'll give you $ \VAL L3 to just buzz off.>
	Msg32 <You've got pretty big ambitions for such a petty criminal. I'll make a deal with you... You can have $ \VAL L3 if you just go away.>
	Msg33 <A fight would only weaken you and slow me down, so why don't we make a deal? I'll give you $ \VAL L3 to just leave us alone. What do you say?>
