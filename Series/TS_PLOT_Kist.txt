	Msg1 <Right now, the Bone Devils are too strong for us to fight. They've got enough mecha that any action on our part, no matter how quick, would result in Kist being devestated.>
	Msg2 <Recently the Bone Devils have lost a lot of mecha in battle... But it's still not enough. We can't attack them until we're sure their retaliation won't flatten the village.>
	Msg3 <The Bone Devils have been losing their fight with the Federation Defense Force... Now is the time for us to act! If we can destroy their last remaining mecha, they'll be forced to leave town!>
	Msg4 <I need to speak with you... Kist is in trouble. The Bone Devil gang controls this town, doing whatever they want, killing anyone who opposes them. We need allies to drive them out of town for good. Will you join us?>
	Msg5 <Your heroic deeds are well known to everyone... Our village suffers under the grip of the Bone Devils; we need a hero to help get rid of them. Will you join us?>
	Msg6 <There may well be no hope for us...>
	Msg7 <\ELEMENT 2 in Kist asked you to help overthrow the Bone Devil gang.>
	Msg8 <Please hurry... Kist has suffered long enough!>
	Msg9 <These coordinates will take you to their secret base. Once there, you can destroy their mecha... Our hopes go with you...>
	Msg10 <You were defeated... Now the Bone Devils will regroup, move their camp, and hire some reinforcements. We'll have to work harder.>
	Msg11 <The Bone Devils have been defeated! My village is free... we have no money to reward you with, only our eternal gratitude.>
	Msg12 <You helped rid Kist of the Bone Devil gang.>

	Msg1 <There's been some idiots in town who want to stand against the Bone Devils. If you have any info that might lead us to their boss, I could make it worth your while.>
	Msg2 <No kidding? We can get rid of \OPR E2 right away. Here's a cash reward just like I said... Remember, nobody crosses the Bone Devils and lives to tell about it.>
