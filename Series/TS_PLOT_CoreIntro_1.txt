	name <PLOT: SL Core Intro>

	% This plot is meant to provide a standard introduction to
	% the core storyline- namely, that some faction or another is
	% planning a takeover of the Federated Territories.

	% The first anyone will hear of this is when a weapons
	% cache is discovered outside of Snake Lake. The PC may
	% get to take part in the discovery, if he's quick enough.
	% Otherwise the story will progress by itself (in about 48
	% hours) and the existance/implications of the weapon cache
	% will be featured on the news.

	% There will be two ways for the PC to get involved in this
	% story: By method one, the PC will speak with a special
	% investigator at the Guardian's HQ building, and get the
	% mission there. By method two, the PC will speak with a
	% bandit in Snake Lake who has heard of the weapons cache
	% and hopes to capture it himself.

	% Once the mission begins, the PC will have to penetrate an
	% armored fortress by mecha, then explore a dangerous complex
	% on foot. When the weapons are discovered, it is realized that
	% they are Hunter-X biocombatants. It will also be realized that
	% there are enough present for a major invasion.

	% Who is behind this plot, and why? Well, that will have to
	% wait until I've done some more work on the endgame et cetera.

	Msg2 <I'm still looking for clues about that weapon smuggling ring. I haven't found anything yet, but neither has \ELEMENT 3 .>
	Msg3 <Drat. I've been hoping to track down a weapon smuggler that the guardians are looking for. He's very mysterious... no-one even knows his name, or even if he exists! The reward is real enough, though. That's all I care about.>
	Msg4 <Hm? That's awful suspicious... or just my wishful thinking. I'm on the lookout for a weapon smuggler who's working in the area. We don't even know his name, but there's a big reward for his capture!>
