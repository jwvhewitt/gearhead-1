	Msg1 <I've been waiting to hear of your progress. Have you found the Ruby yet?>
	Msg2 <Then you should try harder. When I hired you for this mission I expected results.>
	Msg3 <It is held by the Cyclops biosoldiers, who doubtlessly will use it to clone more of their kind. Many years ago they destroyed the village of Nara and set up a breeding colony deep underground. You will find the Ruby there.>
	Msg4 <Ah, this ruby will ensure the continuing dominance of Kettel Industries for the foreseeable future. Here's a reward, as you were promised.>
	Msg5 <I know that if the Ruby was there, you would have been able to get it. I suppose the ruby must have been destroyed in the many years following the Night of Fire. Thank you for your efforts, but without the ruby there can be no reward.>
	Msg6 <I know that you wouldn't lie about something like that... I suppose the ruby must have been destroyed in the many years following the Night of Fire. Thank you for your efforts, but without the ruby there can be no reward.>
	Msg7 <You appear to be telling the truth... I suppose the ruby must have been destroyed in the many years following the Night of Fire. Thank you for your efforts, but without the ruby there can be no reward.>
	Msg8 <Were you too lazy to search the caves, or did those monsters pay you off to lie to me? No matter; we will continue our search for the Ruby, and we will find it!>
	Msg9 <Elisha Kettel in The Factory has offered you $500000 to recover the Iria Ruby from the Nara Ruins.>
	Msg10 <Hello \RANK \PC . Kettel Industries needs a dedicated employee such as yourself for a difficult mission of great importance. If you're interested, I can give you the details right now.>
	Msg11 <You've been making a good name for yourself, \PC . Kettel Industries needs a highly skilled cavalier for a difficult mission. If you're interested, I can give you the details.>
	Msg12 <I believe that you have a bright future ahead of you. Kettel Industries needs a highly motivated cavalier for a dangerous mission. If you're interested, I can give you the details.>
	Msg13 <You retrieved the Iria Ruby for Elisha Kettel.>
	Msg14 <You protected the Iria Ruby from Elisha Kettel.>
	Msg15 <That's too bad. Come back later when you have time and the position may still be open.>
	Msg16 <We have been researching a PreZero artifact known as the "Iria Ruby". This artifact is currently held by the Cyclops, leftover bioweapons from the Age of Superpowers. The reward for bringing me this ruby is $500,000.>
	Msg17 <The Cyclops live in the ruins of Nara, a village they destroyed many years ago. You can find them if you head north along the coast. Their cave is well hidden and heavily defended. Here's a cash allowance to help you prepare for the trip.>
	Msg18 <Then I will find someone else to do the job. Thank you for your time.>
	Msg19 <I thought you had a future in this company. It appears that I was mistaken.>
	Msg20 <You have disappointed me. Fine, I will locate another to do this task.>
	Msg101 <We must work hard to keep our company in the number one spot!>
	Msg102 <Those who serve Kettel Industries will be rewarded greatly.>
	Msg103 <Kettel Industries sponsors research programs all over the globe.>
	Msg104 <We may soon require the services of a skilled adventurer. Preparations are underway...>
	Msg105 <Have you driven a "Jos" today?>
	Prompt1 <I'm still working on it.>
	Prompt2 <Where did you say it was, again?>
	Prompt3 <Here it is. [Give Ruby]>
	Prompt4 <Sorry, the Ruby no longer exists.>
	Prompt5 <I'm interested. Tell me more.>
	Prompt6 <Sorry, I'm not able to help right now.>
	Prompt7 <I'll do it!>
	Prompt8 <No, I don't want this mission.>
	Prompt9 <I've decided to quit this mission.>

	Msg1 <You should not do anything to abuse our trust while you stay here; otherwise the repercussions could be terrible.>
	Msg2 <Remember what we have spoken about; the Iria Ruby should remain where it is, for the good of all involved.>
	Msg3 <Humans do not generally come to this place unless they are invited. What purpose do you have to visit?>
	Msg4 <Truthfully?>
	Msg5 <They are known to us. They are a human faction which seeks wealth and control. Also, power... For what purpose have they sent you here?>
	Msg6 <The Iria Ruby? Its existance is known to just a few... That is a very powerful and dark artifact. The secrets it contains could be very dangerous. Why do you seek such an accursed stone?>
	Msg7 <It may be so.>
	Msg8 <Investigate? I would assume that you were sent here to locate the Iria Ruby. It would be far better for yourself and all involved if your employer would simply forget that goal.>
	Msg9 <You are free to investigate all you want, but take nothing from this cave. The consequences would be most severe.>
	Msg10 <Your shamelessness is admirable, but you have no chance to survive.>
	Msg11 <Historic research? Then you should visit Hwang-Sa Temple, and view their archives. They can assist you with all but the most dangerous knowledge contained within the ruby.>
	Msg12 <Hired to recover it? I can guess by who. I am sorry I cannot permit you to do that. The Ruby must remain where it is; it would be far too dangerous for the world were it permitted to leave.>
	Msg13 <It is a computer from the last age containing knowledge of forbidden technology. It knows the location of nuclear stockpiles among other more sinister things. In the hands of an ambitious human, it could bring great sorrow to this world.>
	Msg14 <The Ruby is needed at HwangSa? Strange, Kaema would normally have come himself for so dangerous an artifact... Still, you are a monk in good standing, so I must trust you. Here is the Ruby. Return it to us once you are finished with it.>
	Msg15 <The Ruby is needed at HwangSa? Strange, we have not been informed of this need through the regular channels. Still, I must trust in Kaema's judgement. Here is the Ruby. Return it to us once you are finished with it.>
	Msg16 <Please do not try so obvious a deception in my presence again. All you have succeeded in doing is to reveal your own ineptitude.>
	Msg17 <You are clearly serious. We cannot allow you to endanger this world.>
	Msg18 <The Ruby must remain here, for the sake of all. It is our purpose to keep the mistakes of the past from ever happening again... to that end, it would be best for the Ruby's existance to remain a secret, and for it to remain in our protection.>
	Msg19 <The sins of the past must never be repeated. If you are truly concerned with the future of this world and both our species, you will do what you can to protect this knowledge.>
	Msg21 <To disagree is your right, as a free individual. However, if you attempt to take the Ruby, we will be forced to protect it.>
	Msg22 <It is far to the south of here. You better set off soon... it's quite a long trip.>
	Prompt1 <No reason.>
	Prompt2 <I was sent by Kettel Industries.>
	Prompt3 <I'm looking for the Iria Ruby.>
	Prompt4 <Really.>
	Prompt5 <Actually, I'm looking for the Iria Ruby.>
	Prompt6 <I'm just here to investigate.>
	Prompt7 <I'm here to get the Iria Ruby.>
	Prompt8 <I was sent to exterminate your kind!>
	Prompt9 <Uh, I need it for historic research.>
	Prompt10 <I was hired to retrieve it.>
	Prompt11 <Why is the ruby so important?>
	Prompt12 <Actually, Hwang-Sa Temple sent me here!>
	Prompt13 <I'll take it whether you like it or not.>
	Prompt14 <I can see your point.>
	Prompt15 <I agree with you.>
	Prompt16 <Sorry, I can't agree with that.>
