Msg1 <QUENTIN:// Can you hear me alright? Then let's begin the tutorial. You'll notice a control menu to your right. Use this command your mecha.>
Msg2 <QUENTIN:// To start with, just move forward one square. Select the option marked "Walk" and press space.>
Msg202 <Move forward using "Walk".>
Msg3 <QUENTIN:// Good. Practice moving for a little while. You can also turn left and right using the menu. You'll see your facing as a compass display in the information window.>
Msg203 <Practice movement using the menu.>
Msg4 <QUENTIN:// A bit lower on your menu is an item marked "Roll". Select that option now, and you'll change from walking to using the wheels in your mecha's feet.>
Msg5 <QUENTIN:// Go forward using 'Cruise Speed' or 'Full Speed'. Rolling is faster than walking, but you lose a certain amount of maneuverability.>
Msg204 <Change move mode to "Roll", then move using "Cruise Speed".>
Msg6 <QUENTIN:// Excellent. Move around using the wheels for a bit. I'll call you in a minute with further instructions.>
Msg206 <Practice movement again.>
Msg7 <QUENTIN:// Very good. I've indicated a waypoint for you. It should appear as a exclamation point on your map. Go there now.>
Msg207 <Go to "!" waypoint.>
Msg8 <QUENTIN:// Well done. By the way, if you want to look around the entire map at once, select 'Info Menu/Examine Map'. While you're on foot the same function can be selected by the 'l' key.>
Msg9 <QUENTIN:// Put a bit of distance between yourself and the waypoint. Our next lesson is going to be with your mecha's weapon systems.>
Msg208 <Move away from waypoint.>
Msg10 <QUENTIN:// That's far enough. Rotate to face the waypoint. Then, open your weapons menu and fire at it.>
Msg210 <Fire Laser Cannon at waypoint using "Weapons Menu".>
Msg211 <Move away from waypoint to end tutorial.>
Msg11 <QUENTIN:// Select the laser cannon, then choose the waypoint to fire. You won't destroy it, of couse, since it's just a hologram. When you're satisfied move away from the area.>
Msg12 <QUENTIN:// That's the basics of mecha operation. If you don't like using the menu, you can set mecha control to the roguelike interface. Power down and come meet me in the shop.>

Msg101 <Roger.>
Msg102 <Let's end the tutorial.>
Msg103 <QUENTIN:// Are you absolutely certain that you want to return? We haven't finished everything yet.>
Msg104 <I wanna come home.>
Msg105 <I'll stay for the rest.>
