		CMsg6_4 <ifNPCPassionate Accept>
		Msg6_5 <It looks like \NARRATIVE 2 isn't getting their money's worth out of that contract on your head. Still, with every wannabe hitman in the FedTer aiming for you, it won't be long before they hit the jackpot.>
		CMsg6_5 <ifNPCCheerful Accept>
		Msg6_6 <Good to see you're still alive. According to the talk on the street, you should be dead for ages. Every yahoo with a mecha is lining up to collect the contract \NARRATIVE 2 has on your head.>

		Msg9_1 <I know the identity of the action merchant who's hosting the contract. You see, \NARRATIVE 2 doesn't handle this directly, they contract out to a murder gang. If you stop them you effectively stop the contract.>
		CMsg9_1 <ifNPCSociable Accept>
		Msg9_2 <That depends. I know who's hosting the contract, if you'd like to put that particular action merchant out of business.>
		CMsg9_2 <ifNPCShy Accept>
		Msg9_3 <I wouldn't waste your time if I didn't. \NARRATIVE 2 contracted out this hit to an action merchant in the dead-zone. Defeat his gang and the whole machination should fall apart.>
		CMsg9_3 <ifNPCEasygoing Accept>
		Msg9_4 <Don't underestimate me. I know that the contract placed by \NARRATIVE 2 is being administered by a murder gang in the dead-zone; if you destroy the gang, the economic incentive to kill you disappears as well.>
		CMsg9_4 <ifNPCPassionate Accept>
		Msg9_5 <It's your lucky day. You should know that \NARRATIVE 2 doesn't handle this kind of thing itself; they contracted out to a dead-zone murder gang. All you have to do now is defeat them.>
		CMsg9_5 <ifNPCCheerful Accept>
		Msg9_6 <I can tell you, but I can't guarantee that you'll want to hear it. The contract placed by \NARRATIVE 2 is being hosted by a murder gang in the dead-zone. The only way to end it is to put them out of business, and that won't be easy.>

		Msg10_1 <I heard you were pretty cocky... But I don't think you can take them all. Fortunately you don't have to. The hit's been contracted out to a dead-zone murder gang. Defeat them and you'll be safe for a while.>
		CMsg10_1 <ifNPCSociable Accept>
		Msg10_2 <That may be, but there's a better suggestion. What you need to do is take the fight to the murder gang that's holding the contract.>
		CMsg10_2 <ifNPCShy Accept>
		Msg10_3 <Honestly, in some of these cases just sitting back and doing nothing really isn't the best solution. Not when you can take the fight to the murder gang holding the contract, and wipe them off the face of the Earth...>
		CMsg10_3 <ifNPCEasygoing Accept>
		Msg10_4 <Pretty confident of your own abilities, aren't you? Admirable though that may be, you can't count on them giving up anytime soon. However, if you were to destroy the murder gang hosting the contract, that could buy you some time...>
		CMsg10_4 <ifNPCPassionate Accept>
		Msg10_5 <You're an optimist. I like that. In any case, there's a better solution... I happen to know that the contract on your life is being administered by a dead-zone murder gang. Destroy the gang and the contract disappears, at least for a while.>
		CMsg10_5 <ifNPCCheerful Accept>
