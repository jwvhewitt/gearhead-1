	Msg1 <Right now the arena is being prepared for the next battle.>
	Msg2 <The next battle is about to start. Are your mecha ready?>
	Msg3 <Really? Well, I'm sure a famous pilot like you will have no trouble getting a new one.>
	Msg4 <Come on now. I know that you'll be able to find another one. You're champion material, after all.>
	Msg5 <If you don't have a mecha, you can't take part in the contest. Better find one quick or you'll be disqualified.>

	Msg6 <Ah, one of our Robot Warriors legends is back for another go at it. We've got some new competitors, they think they can take you, if you'd like to have a go at it.>
	Msg7 <You're in the finals now. Just a few more matches and you'll be fighting for the championship. The competition is getting really harsh... Best of luck, and may the best pilot win!>
	Msg8 <You've made it to the semi-finals. You've shown yourself to be better than most... but could you be the best? Just a few more battles and you'll be in our series finals. It's time for mayhem!>
	Msg9 <You've won a few fights. Maybe you're good enough to go all the way. There's only one way to find out, and it's a hard unforgiving road. Are you tough enough for Robot Warriors?>
	Msg10 <Welcome to Robot Warriors, where armored titans come to bash each other senseless. Think you have what it takes? Well, let's find out. Let the trials begin!>

	Msg11 <This is it, your final bout... Make it through this one and you'll be crowned Robot Warriors champion! Are you nervous? You should be!>
	Msg12 <LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WE HAVE A WINNER!!! Congradulations upon your tenth Robot Warriors victory! Enjoy your prizes and newfound fame!>
	Msg13 <Let the games begin!!!>
	Msg14 <Go talk to Johnathan about that special rematch you just took part in.>
	Msg15 <Shame about what happened to Johnathan, wasn't it? He was one fine sportscaster.>

	Msg16 <Good job out there. Here's your prize money, now go get your robot cleaned up before the next match.>

	Msg1 <It's a privilege to see you in the Robot Warriors pit again. You know I'm not supposed to have any favorites, but I think we both know who I'm rooting for. Do you need any help?>
	Msg2 <Need oil? Armor patches? An entirely new battle-bot? All the amenities of the pit are here at your disposal. Get ready for your next battle.>
	Msg3 <I have a feeling that you and your machine could go a long way in this competition. Keep your gear in top shape; I don't want to be disappointed.>
	Msg4 <It's important to keep your mecha in shape between battles. Always stop by to have your damage repaired and your ammunition reloaded.>
	Msg5 <You're still here? Well, you might want to keep your mecha in shape, since there's a lot of folks here in the pit who are eager to wreck it up again.>
	Msg6 <Back for more punishment, eh? It's always a pleasure watching your robot get trashed. The arena battles are more interesting if both machines start out fully functional, so you might as well get repaired.>
	Msg7 <Welcome to the pit. This is where our Robot Warriors competitors keep their machines in top shape. If you need anything, you can come see me.>
	Msg8 <Congradulations!!! I knew that you were going to win the tournament! You've come a long way, overcome a lot of problems, and defeated a lot of excellent pilots to win the championship. Enjoy your victory, you certainly deserve it!>
	Msg9 <Good job! You've come a long way, overcome a lot of obstacles, and defeated a lot of very good pilots to win the championship.>
	Msg10 <Congradulations! This has been a great suprise for me. You know, a lot of people said that you didn't have what it takes to be a Robot Warriors champion, but I guess you've showed them. That was a smashing victory. Good job.>

	Msg4 <This is a special event, and it's the only chance you'll get. If you can't take part in the combat I'm afraid that I'll have to declare one of the other pilots the winner.>
	Msg5 <That's too bad. It would have really improved our ratings if you had taken part...>
	Msg6 <Head on over to the arena and take your starting position. The match will start in just a few minutes.>
	Msg7 <I don't believe it! They threw everything they had into the melee, and you still came out on top! What an amazing battle that was! Here, I'm pleased to give you this prize money. Congradulations!>
