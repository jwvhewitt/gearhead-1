		prompt3 <Maybe you can explain some things.>
		prompt4 <What does "DC" mean?>
		prompt5 <What does "DP" mean?>
		prompt6 <What does "ACC" mean?>
		prompt7 <What does "RNG" mean?>
		prompt8 <What does "SPD" mean?>
		prompt9 <What does "BV" mean?>
		prompt10 <What is "10/10a"?>
		prompt11 <What is "$", and what's that number for?>
		prompt12 <What does "AC" mean?>
		prompt13 <What does "SF" mean?>
		MSG1 <Welcome to my shop. It's not particularly impressive, I know, but I think you'll be pleased with our selection.>
		MSG2 <Look, I already told you it isn't very impressive! I'm gonna spruce it up once I've decided on a paint scheme! You wanna see what I've got or not?>
		MSG3 <Come back once you've earned some more money, okay?>
		MSG4 <Take a look around, let me know if you see anything you like.>
		MSG5 <It would be my pleasure. It's hard to be a smart consumer when you don't know what you're buying, and modern technology can be very confusing on times. What do you want to know about?>
		MSG6 <DC means Damage Class. The higher it is, the more damage a weapon will do. There are other things to consider when buying a weapon but for most people DC is the most important factor.>
		MSG7 <DP means Damage Points. It's a measure of how much punishment an object can take before it breaks down. If DP is preceded by a number in brackets, that's the armor rating of this item.>
		MSG8 <ACC refers to the accuracy of a weapon. A positive value means that you will hit more often. A negative value means you'll hit less often. Many weapons have ACC:0, meaning that they neither aid nor hinder your natural skill.>
		MSG9 <RNG refers to the range of a weapon. There are three range bands. It is easiest to hit a target at short range, slightly more difficult to hit at medium range, and much more difficult at long range.>
		MSG10 <SPD is short for speed. It measures the recharge time of a weapon. This is usually only important for fighters who have good initiative, since there's no point in having your weapon recharge faster than you are able to fire it.>
		MSG11 <BV is short for Burst Value. Some weapons can fire a large number of shots in a single action. If you use burst fire you are more likely to hit and will probably do better damage, but you'll also run out of ammunition much sooner.>
		MSG12 <This is the weapon's ammunition counter. The first value is the number of rounds currently in the magazine; the second value is the maximum number of rounds that the weapon can hold.>
		MSG13 <*sigh* You really don't get out much, do you? "$" means money. You can exchange money for goods and services. The number is how many pieces of money you need for the transaction. Understand now? Well, try not to think too hard.>
		MSG15 <AC means Armor Class. The higher your AC value, the less damage you'll take when struck by an attack.>
		MSG16 <SF means Scale Factor. Meks can have low-scale weapons installed for dealing with small enemies. There's a penalty for shooting at something smaller than yourself, so an antipersonnel weapon can be a good thing to have.>

		Msg9 <Suit yourself.>
		Msg10 <Nara was a real quiet town, not the sort of place you'd expect this to happen. All of a sudden one day an army of monsters showed up on our doorstep, no indication where they came from, all sizes and shapes and mean as hell.>
		Msg11 <At first the orders were to fight them off. One hour later that plan was abandoned, and we were ordered to evacuate the civilians. I was a young punk with a big gun, more courage than brains, and I dug in to protect the buses.>
		Msg12 <Mostly, yeah, but I didn't. One of the creatures shot me with a plasma weapon, nearly vaporized the left side of my face. I thought I was gone for sure. I looked up, and towering over me was a great big one-eyed monster.>
		Msg13 <That's the amazing thing. That monster asked me, in perfect English, whether or not I was okay. It stood guard over me, and its companions helped drive off the creatures that were threatening the buses.>

		Msg1 <Hello! It's nice to see a new face down here... we don't get many visitors. Of course, I wouldn't trade my research for the world.>
		Msg2 <This sewer is the natural habitat of albino alligators. I've been tracking the movements of a particularly old male that we call "Bone-Cracker". His lair is somewhere below this research station.>
		Msg3 <Well, Bone-Cracker does seem to have a fondness for human flesh, but I've been here so long that I apparently smell like the environment, so I'm apparently safe.>
		Msg4 <If you're attacked by an albino alligator, run away. One bite can easily mean instant death. If you have to fight, aim for the belly where their scales are softest. They're good at hiding in water and vegetation, so be very cautious.>
		Msg5 <The Snake Lake department of sanitation has given me a research grant. Bone-Cracker has eaten several of their workers, as well as a number of bounty hunters sent here to get rid of him.>
		Msg6 <He's bigger than most albino alligators, very aggressive, and likes to eat people. In his lair downstairs he's accumulated quite a collection of bones, weapons, and shiny objects taken from the people he's killed.>
		Msg7 <Maybe I can help you. Living down here and studying the local wildlife, I've picked up a thing or two about first aid...>
		Msg8 <Have a good expedition.>
		Msg9 <What... You have Bone-Cracker with you!? He's been tamed? This is incredible... How did you ever manage to do that?>
		Msg10 <My research project is done now. I'm getting ready to return to the surface.>
		Msg11 <Well... if you don't mind, would you mind if I studied him for a while? I could learn so much by observing him up close. Don't worry, Bone-Cracker won't be harmed... not that I think I could do that anyhow.>
		Msg12 <Thank you! In return, here's what's left of my research grant. I guess I don't have any reason to stay down here now... Bone-Cracker and I will go to the Wujung University Reptiles Center.>
		Msg13 <I understand. Well, now that Bone-Cracker is leaving, I guess there's nothing left for me to study here. I'll be packing up and returning to the university soon.>
		Msg14 <It's very strange... My remote sensors have lost track of Bone-Cracker. I guess he could have died, but he was in pretty good health and there's nothing down there powerful enough to fight him.>
		Msg15 <Well, unless I can find him again, my research project here is over.>
		Msg16 <You did what!? Why did you do that!? There was no reason to go into his territory... And now my research project is ruined! I guess there's nothing left for me but to return to the university...>
		Prompt1 <What exactly are you researching?>
		Prompt2 <Isn't that dangerous?>
		Prompt3 <What should I do if I meet one?>
		Prompt4 <Why are you doing this?>
		Prompt5 <Tell me about Bone-Cracker.>
		Prompt6 <Help! I've been injured!>
		Prompt7 <It wasn't easy.>
		Prompt8 <Just another day's work for me.>
		Prompt9 <Alright, you can have him.>
		Prompt10 <Sorry, I'd rather keep him with me.>
		Prompt11 <I don't know anything about that.>
