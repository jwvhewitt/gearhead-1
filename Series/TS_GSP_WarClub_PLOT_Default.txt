	Msg1 <Archaeology can be an interesting field.>
	Msg2 <I'm too busy right now to discuss the truly important, world-shaking implications of my latest research.>
	Msg3 <This latest research will be very important, if I can manage to get all the supplies I need.>
	Msg4 <If you want to hear about my fascinating research, you can read all about it in the university journal.>
	Msg5 <I can't stop... I have figures to work out!>

	Msg6 <I have a job available for a seasoned adventurer, if you're interested.>
	Msg7 <I need the services of an experienced adventurer. I thought you might be interested.>
	Msg8 <I have an expedition planned to recover an artefact of moderate technological interest. How would you like the position of chief field agent?>
	Msg9 <Are you an adventurer? I have a reward available, if you can recover an item that has been lost.>
	Msg10 <My job here prevents me from doing much field work, but I have a job available for anyone willing to do some sample recovery work.>

	Msg11 <I'm very busy right now. I have to arrange for an explorer to run a field recovery mission for me...>
	Msg12 <My research has located an old PreZero artifact. I need to recover it for study.>
	Msg13 <I don't have much time to chat... My research has located a possibly important artifact, and I need to make the arrangements for a recovery expedition.>
	Msg14 <Shouldn't you find out what, exactly, this job involves before you start asking about money? Honestly...>
	Msg15 <That's too bad.>

	Msg16 <I'll bet you do...>
	Msg17 <I've been researching a weapon program from before the great war. Their only working prototype went missing on its first test run somewhere near here. I want to get it.>
	Msg18 <Does the name \ELEMENT 3 mean anything to you? Probably not... there was supposedly only one ever built. It went missing many years ago on its first field test, and I think I know where.>
	Msg19 <An ultrapowerful weapon called the \ELEMENT 3 was lost many years ago in this area. I want to recover it so that I can study its inner workings.>
	Msg20 <I've been researching a PreZero weapons program. Their prototype went missing on its first field test, and I think I know where to find it. This weapon would be a great help to my studies.>

	Msg21 <Thanks! I think I'm going to need it...>
	Msg22 <Luck is for the superstitious.>
	Msg23 <Yes, I think you could... There is an object lost in a dangerous place near here. I need an adventurer to recover it for me.>
	Msg24 <No, I don't think you'd be very well suited to this mission. I really need someone with a better scientific background.>
	Msg25 <I know you could do the mission, but I don't know that I can trust you... Once you find this artefact, what are the chances that you'll keep it for yourself or sell it to someone else?>

	Msg26 <Maybe I can believe you, and maybe I can't... In any case, you're the only volunteer I have. The mission is yours if you want it.>
	Msg27 <That's not a risk I'm willing to take, in this case. I'll find someone else for the mission.>
	Msg28 <Hmmm... It might be a gamble, but at least I know you're skilled enough to get the artifact. The mission is yours if you want it.>
	Msg29 <The \ELEMENT 3 used an advanced power source of unknown type. If I could replicate it, the technology could have many peaceful applications.>
	Msg30 <The \ELEMENT 3 was a marvel of technology. By examining how it was built I may be able to advance our understanding of superconductive physics.>

	Msg31 <The prototype was lost before it could be made into a production model... If I could replicate this weapons technology, I could sell it for millions!>
	Msg32 <Records indicate that the \ELEMENT 3 was lost in \ELEMENT 2 along with its field agent. Presumably they met some grisly end... I can provide $ \VAL P2 to recover it.>
	Msg33 <The \ELEMENT 3 should currently be located in \ELEMENT 2 if my research is correct. I can pay you $ \VAL P2 to go there and recover it.>
	Msg34 <\ELEMENT 2 is most likely its current location. I'll pay $ \VAL P2 if you can retrieve the \ELEMENT 3 and bring it to me safely.>
	Msg35 <Your search should center around \ELEMENT 2 since that's the last known place the \ELEMENT 3 was being tested. Bring it back to me and I'll give you $ \VAL P2 for your troubles.>

	Msg36 <Fine, I'll just hire someone else to go to \ELEMENT 2 and bring it back for me... Er, disregard that last bit.>
	Msg37 <Fine, I'll just hire someone else to go retrieve it for me.>
	Msg38 <Have you found the \ELEMENT 3 yet?>
	Msg39 <I'm very busy with my other research. Come back here immediately after you've completed your job.>
	Msg40 <Is there any problem? Shouldn't you be out looking for \ELEMENT 3 right about now?>

	Msg41 <Thank you for a job well done. Here's the pay that you were promised.>
	Msg42 <Is that so? Well, I'll just have to wait for you to suffer the same unfortunate fate as the original tester, then the \ELEMENT 3 will be mine...>
	Msg43 <That's very unfortunate. Be careful... My research indicates certain instabilities in the design.>
	Msg44 <I need your help. There's some field work that I need done... It's very important to my research.>
	Msg45 <Hi. I've got a job for you, if you're not too busy. I need someone to do a bit of dungeon field work.>

	Msg46 <My studies have indicated that a prezero prototype weapon was lost somewhere near here.>
	Msg47 <I need to make preparations... I have to go on a field mission soon.>
	Msg48 <I'm on the verge of a breakthrough. All I need is to find a lost and potentially dangerous prototype weapon which may or may not be located near here, then disassemble it and find out how it works.>
	Msg49 <I've been tracing the whereabouts of an abandoned weapon prototype. I think I'm close to a breakthrough.>
	Msg50 <I'm getting ready to make an expedition into the dungeons. It will likely be very dangerous.>

	Msg51 <Maybe you could... I better warn you, though, that this isn't very interesting. Are you sure you want to know?>
	Msg52 <Well, I'll do okay on my own. That's what I was planning to do anyways.>
	Msg53 <Not really. I can handle this perfectly well on my own, and if not I can always hire a member of the Hunter's Guild.>
	Msg54 <\ELEMENT 4 in \SCENE EScene 4 wants you to recover the \ELEMENT 3 from \ELEMENT 2 for scientific research.>

	Prompt1 <Alright, tell me about it.>
	Prompt2 <I've got more important things to do.>
	Prompt3 <How much are you willing to pay?>
	Prompt4 <I could help you with that.>
	Prompt5 <Well, good luck...>

	Prompt6 <Why do you need this weapon?>
	Prompt7 <I'll recover it for you.>
	Prompt8 <What's the reward going to be?>
	Prompt9 <Where can I find it?>
	Prompt10 <Give me the details.>

	Prompt11 <I promise I won't do that.>
	Prompt12 <That's the chance you'll have to take.>
	Prompt13 <On second thought, I won't help you.>
	Prompt14 <Here it is. [Give Item]>
	Prompt15 <I found it, and decided to keep it.>

	Prompt16 <I can't complete this mission.>
	Prompt17 <Sorry, I can't.>
	Prompt18 <Maybe I can be of help to you.>
	Prompt19 <Sorry, if it's boring I'm not interested.>
