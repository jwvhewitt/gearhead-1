	Msg5 <It's you! It will be a great honor for me to kill you with my own hands. I am \PERSONA E4 of the murder club, but everyone calls me "Walking Weapon"! You've defeated one of our weaker members. Now it's time to meet your end!>

	%  23 - 24 :  Plan "A" has worked.
	Msg23 <I have never seen such purity of spirit before... Your soul is stronger than my warrior nature. Perhaps there is something more important than being most powerful? Alright, let's not do battle. I will surrender to the police.>
	Msg24 <You are truly unafraid of me, yet you do not attack... your peaceful nature is more powerful than my warrior spirit. I have been shown the error of my ways. I will turn myself in to the guardians, and attempt to reform my life by your example.>

	%  25 - 26 :  Plan "B" has worked.
	Msg25 <Ulp... well, I'm too young to die yet... I changed my mind... I don't want to be a warrior after all. I'm going to go turn myself in to the guardians... they'll protect me from you...>
	Msg26 <Thinking about it more carefully, I think you could be right... I'm just going to go turn myself in to the guardians now. I'm too young to die senselessly.>

	%  27 - 28 :  Plan "B" has failed.
