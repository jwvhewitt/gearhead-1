	Msg1 <All who live must some day pass from this world.>
	Msg2 <The life of an adventurer is perilous, and frequently far too short.>
	Msg3 <Our time in this world is measured not by what we have earned, but by what we have done.>
	Msg4 <Life is measured not by time, but by actions. All people must die but not all truly live.>
	Msg5 <Life is short and precious. Be mindful of how you spend yours.>

	Msg6 <I may have a task for you. A special package needs to be escorted to its final destination... This is a spiritual matter. It would be greatly appreciated if you could aid us now.>
	Msg7 <This urn contains the ashes of a poor unfortunate adventurer. The family wishes for it to be placed in \ELEMENT 2 eternally.>
	Msg8 <I'm afraid that the job does not pay anything. This is simply a mission of charity, if you are still interested in helping.>
	Msg9 <If it is money you are after, then I am afraid I will have to find someone else for this job. Sorry for wasting your time.>
	Msg10 <I understand. I will find someone else to complete this task.>

	Msg11 <Well, there wasn't very much of the deceased left to recover... \ELEMENT 2 is apparently a very inhospitable place.>
	Msg12 <That is good! Come back here once you have placed the urn.>
	Msg13 <Well, because \ELEMENT 2 is where the deceased departed from this mortal plane. The family thought it appropriate.>
	Msg14 <In that case, I certainly hope that the future brings you better days. One of the acolytes will no doubt be able to complete this task. Go now in peace.>
	Msg15 <Welcome back. Have you placed the urn in \ELEMENT 2 yet?>

	Msg16 <I see. Well, I guess there is nothing more to say on the matter.>
	Msg17 <Very good. The spirit of the deceased can rest peacefully now.>
	Msg18 <Well, keep working on it. The urn must be placed in \ELEMENT 2 as per the family's wishes.>
	Msg19 <The urn has been lost!? This most certainly is an unfortunate event... I must get in touch with the family immediately.>
	Msg20 <\ELEMENT 1 wants you to place the \ELEMENT 3 in \ELEMENT 2>

	Msg21 <Are you absolutely certain that you left the urn in the correct place? It was supposed to go to \ELEMENT 2 you know...>
	Msg22 <Maybe you should. Come back here again once you're sure.>

	Prompt1 <I'd be glad to help you.>
	Prompt2 <How much does the job pay?>
	Prompt3 <Sorry, I'm busy right now.>
	Prompt4 <It's not very big...>
	Prompt5 <I'll do it right away!>
	Prompt6 <Why leave the ashes in a dungeon?>
	Prompt7 <Okay, I'll do it.>
	Prompt8 <I can't afford to help you for free.>
	Prompt9 <I have done as you asked.>
	Prompt10 <Still working on it...>

	Prompt11 <The urn has been lost...>
	Prompt12 <Maybe I should go double check...>
	Prompt13 <Of course I'm certain!>
