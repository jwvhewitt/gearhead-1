	Msg1 <That tower outside of town? It collapsed. There's nothing left but rubble.>
	Msg2 <While hiking, I found the ruins of an old skyscraper. A brilliant light shone from the top floor. I wanted to go in but the place looked like it was about to collapse.>
	Msg3 <\ELEMENT 2 in \ELEMENT 1 discovered a ruined tower with a brilliant light at the top.>
	Msg4 <Sure, I can do that, but as I mentioned it didn't look very safe. Do you want to go now or will you do it later?>
	Msg5 <I can't say how long it's going to stay there. It looked pretty unstable.>
	Msg6 <You obviously have no spirit of wonder or adventure...>
	Msg7 <Alright. It's probably best that you get ready before doing any serious exploring.>
	Msg8 <This path will take you straight to it. I wonder what the light I saw was... It could be some kind of treasure! Or a monster...>

	Prompt1 <Can you show me where that was?>
	Prompt2 <Hm, I'd like to see that later.>
	Prompt3 <That doesn't concern me.>
