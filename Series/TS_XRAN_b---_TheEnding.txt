	Msg2 <I'm an archeologist. I was researching some PreZero ruins near \ELEMENT 6 , searching for information about the last days before the Night of Fire. Most of the records from that time were destroyed, you know. Any new data would be very helpful.>
	Msg3 <I can't be entirely sure, you know... this isn't exactly scientific, but... but I think it was \ELEMENT 5 who did it.>
	Msg4 <Aside from its academic value? Oh, who am I kidding... The site I am investigating was a military complex. They may have ancient weapons there, possibly even nuclear arms, or worse...>
	Msg5 <Yes, many things... nothing that you'd find interesting, I suppose, but fascinating to an expert in the field. Oh, and there were probably ancient weapons stored at the site. Maybe nuclear missiles. I guess those could be valuable.>
	Msg6 <Well, before my office was ransacked, \ELEMENT 5 kept coming around asking lots of questions. Now I heard about the ruckus in \ELEMENT 6 , and I worry that they're trying to access my site...>
	Msg7 <Of course! But they've got their hands full right now. \ELEMENT 5 has a gang doing something horrible in \ELEMENT 6 , and I think they're trying to access my precious ruin!>
	Msg8 <You're in luck. Not all of my research notes were entered into the computer when my data was stolen... I can show you a shortcut through the ruins, and maybe you can beat \ELEMENT 5 to the weapons...>
