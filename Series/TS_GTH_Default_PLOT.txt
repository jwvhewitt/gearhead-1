	Msg1 <So, you couldn't find what you were looking for? That's a shame... Maybe I'll have better luck myself.>
	Msg1_2 <You didn't get anything? Shame.>
	CMsg1_2 <ifChatNPCShy Accept>
	Msg1_3 <You couldn't find a thing? Maybe the folks who live there took everything with them on vacation...>
	CMsg1_3 <ifChatNPCEasygoing Accept>
	Msg1_4 <You didn't get anything from the house? You see, that's why you're the amateur and I'm the professional.>
	CMsg1_4 <ifChatNPCPassionate Accept>

	Msg2 <You look like the sort who might be up for a bit of thievery. How'd you like to have a go at it?>
	Msg2_1 <Hey, how'd you like to talk about some things? It seems to me that you're not the most honest person out there... and that's not a bad thing. How'd you like to practice your thieving skills?>
	CMsg2_1 <ifChatNPCSociable Accept>
	Msg2_2 <If you're looking for crime, I've got some info for you.>
	CMsg2_2 <ifChatNPCShy Accept>
	Msg2_3 <Hey, we all know there's nothing worse than having to work for your money. If you're willing to do a bit of robbery I have some info that may interest you.>
	CMsg2_3 <ifChatNPCEasygoing Accept>
	Msg2_4 <You look like the sort that enjoys a challenge... How'd you like to try your luck at burglary?>
	CMsg2_4 <ifChatNPCPassionate Accept>
	Msg2_5 <There's no opportunity in this world for people like us, so we have to make our own... How'd you like to try a bit of larceny?>
	CMsg2_5 <ifChatNPCMelancholy Accept>
	Msg2_6 <This is your lucky day. I've got some info on a house just waiting to be robbed, if you're up to scout the place for me.>
	CMsg2_6 <ifChatNPCCheerful Accept>

	Msg3 <That's your loss.>
	Msg3_2 <Whatever.>
	CMsg3_2 <ifChatNPCShy Accept>
	Msg3_3 <It sure beats working for a living.>
	CMsg3_3 <ifChatNPCEasygoing Accept>
	Msg3_4 <So, you're saying you don't have the guts?>

	Msg4 <I've got word on a mansion whose owner has left for the day. There's security, of course, but you should be able to get around that. I hear they've got some nice treasures inside.>
	Msg4_1 <There's a mansion whose owner has left for the day. The only ones there are the security robots, and we both know how smart they are. You go in and grab what you can find; that way I find out about their defenses before going there myself.>
	CMsg4_1 <ifChatNPCSociable Accept>
	Msg4_2 <There's a mansion that's been abandoned by its wealthy owner. Should be able to find some good loot there.>
	CMsg4_2 <ifChatNPCShy Accept>
	Msg4_3 <Some rich family has gone on vacation, leaving their home ripe for the picking. Should be easy to walk on in and grab whatever's been left lying around.>
	CMsg4_3 <ifChatNPCEasygoing Accept>
	Msg4_4 <There's a mansion whose owner is currently out of town. Should be some good loot in there. The security system is pretty tough, but you can look at it as a test of your skills.>
	CMsg4_4 <ifChatNPCPassionate Accept>
	Msg4_5 <An elderly widow has just passed away, leaving no heirs. Her mansion is full of valuable loot. No sense in letting that go to waste, is there?>
	CMsg4_5 <ifChatNPCMelancholy Accept>
	Msg4_6 <A rich family has gone on vacation to Gaos Spinner. I wish we could go with them, but as long as we're stuck planetside, we might as well help ourselves to the treasures left in their unoccupied house, right?>
	CMsg4_6 <ifChatNPCCheerful Accept>
	Msg4_7 <You know, most of the world's wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few. I figure we can do something ourselves to help rectify this imbalance. There's a mansion whose owner is gone for a few days... We can rob him blind.>

	Msg5 <\ELEMENT 1 in \SCENE EScene 1 wants your help to rob a mansion.>

	Msg6_1 <Here's where you can find the place. After you've located all the guard points I'll go in myself and get everything you missed.>
	CMsg6_1 <ifChatNPCSociable Accept>
	Msg6_2 <Here's where you can find the mansion. Good luck.>
	CMsg6_2 <ifChatNPCShy Accept>
	Msg6_3 <See what you can find in there. If you don't find anything, at least you can tell me where the guard stations are.>
	CMsg6_3 <ifChatNPCEasygoing Accept>
	Msg6_4 <The game is afoot...>
	CMsg6_4 <ifChatNPCPassionate Accept>
	Msg6_5 <Those security guards are gonna shoot to kill. You better not let them see you.>
