	Msg2 <\PC ! I haevn't seen you in ages... not since graduation, I think. How have you been? I'm sorry that I didn't write to you all this time but it was a lot of work in the piloting academy, you know?>
	Msg2_1 <\PC ! It's been ages since we've spoken! I was really hoping you'd show up today. Did you get my email? How've you been? Sorry that I haven't kept in touch better, but it was a lot of work in the piloting academy.>
	CMsg2_1 <ifChatNPCSociable Accept>
	Msg2_2 <\PC , I was hoping you'd come here. Did you get my email? I know, I should have kept in touch better, but you know how it is...>
	CMsg2_2 <ifChatNPCShy Accept>
	Msg2_3 <\PC ! It's really been ages, hasn't it? I don't think we've been together like this since graduation. How have you been? We really should have kept in touch... that's probably my fault for not writing.>
	CMsg2_3 <ifChatNPCEasygoing Accept>
	Msg2_4 <\PC !!! Oh, I've missed you so much!!! How are you doing? I haven't seen you since graduation... It's been really busy in the piloting academy, I would have written but things have been so crazy the past few years.>
	CMsg2_4 <ifChatNPCPassionate Accept>
	Msg2_5 <It's good to see you, \PC ! I've been hoping you'd come over. We haven't met face to face since graduation, I think. I've been doing well at the piloting academy. Sorry I didn't write more often.>
	CMsg2_5 <ifChatNPCCheerful Accept>
	Msg2_6 <Ah, \PC , I was a bit worried you wouldn't accept my invitation. It's been very busy for me at the piloting academy. I missed you, and all of our friends from school... I should have written, I know, I just let everyone slip away.>

	Msg3 <I wish our meeting could be under happier circumstances, though. I've got a problem. Tell me... Do you remember \ELEMENT 4 ? We all went to school together. I kind of remember that the two of you didn't get along.>
	Msg3_1 <There's a reason why I called you here. One of our schoolmates is in a lot of trouble. I think there's something really bad going on, and this is only the surface. Remember \ELEMENT 4 ? You two were rivals, weren't you?>
	CMsg3_1 <ifChatNPCSociable Accept>
	Msg3_2 <There's a reason why I asked you here today. Remember \ELEMENT 4 from school?>
	CMsg3_2 <ifChatNPCShy Accept>
	Msg3_3 <Well, I have a problem that I can't solve by myself. A friend of mine... one of our schoolmates... is in bad trouble. You wouldn't happen to remember \ELEMENT 4 , would you?>
	CMsg3_3 <ifChatNPCEasygoing Accept>
	Msg3_4 <As great as it is to see you today, I wish it could be under better circumstances. One of our ex-schoolmates needs help. Do you remember \ELEMENT 4 ?>
	CMsg3_4 <ifChatNPCPassionate Accept>
	Msg3_5 <Unfortunately, I've got a problem. I'm certain that you can help me with it, though. Remember your old rival \ELEMENT 4 ?>
	CMsg3_5 <ifChatNPCCheerful Accept>
	Msg3_6 <I have a very serious problem... or rather, one of our schoolmates does, and I've been entangled into it. Do you remember \ELEMENT 4 ? I seem to recall that you hated each other.>
	CMsg3_6 <ifChatNPCMelancholy Accept>

	Msg4 <I'm a bit embarassed but very happy to hear that. I missed you too. I called you here for a reason today, Tell me... Do you remember \ELEMENT 4 ? We all went to school together. I kind of remember that the two of you didn't get along.>
	Msg4_1 <Then why didn't you write me back, either!? Ah well, each one of us is just as bad as the other... I missed you too, \PC , but I wish our first meeting in so many years could be under better circumstances. Tell me, do you remember \ELEMENT 4 ?>
	CMsg4_1 <ifChatNPCSociable Accept>
	Msg4_2 <I'm glad to hear that. Unfortunately, this isn't just a social call... do you remember \ELEMENT 4 ?>
	CMsg4_2 <ifChatNPCShy Accept>
	Msg4_3 <Me too. Well, I did have a flimsy excuse for calling you here today... Do you remember \ELEMENT 4 ? We went to school together. I seem to recall that the two of you didn't get along very well.>
	CMsg4_3 <ifChatNPCEasygoing Accept>
	Msg4_4 <Not half as much as I missed you, I'll bet. I did have a rationale for calling you here. Do you remember \ELEMENT 4 from school? As I recall the two of you were rivals then.>
	CMsg4_4 <ifChatNPCPassionate Accept>
	Msg4_5 <I'm very happy to hear that! I missed you too. I hear you're a big adventurer now... Well, I'm hoping that you can help with something. Do you remember \ELEMENT 4 from our school days?>
	CMsg4_5 <ifChatNPCCheerful Accept>
	Msg4_6 <Really? I barely expected that you'd even remember me, let alone miss me... I missed you too. Um, I'm afraid that I have a problem... Tell me, do you remember \ELEMENT 4 ? We went to school together.>
	CMsg4_6 <ifChatNPCMelancholy Accept>

	Msg5 <You're right, we both should have. Anyway, there's a reason why I asked you here today. Tell me... Do you remember \ELEMENT 4 ? We all went to school together. I kind of remember that the two of you didn't get along.>
	Msg5_1 <I'm just glad to be speaking with you now. Look, I need to tell you about something... Do you remember our ex-classmate \ELEMENT 4 ? Well, \SPR E4 's mixed up in something really bad.>
	CMsg5_1 <ifChatNPCSociable Accept>
	Msg5_2 <Point taken. In any case, I had a reason for calling you here. Do you remember the name \ELEMENT 4 ?>
	CMsg5_2 <ifChatNPCShy Accept>
	Msg5_3 <Well, there's no sense in talking about the past. I called you here for a reason... Do you remember our ex-classmate \ELEMENT 4 , by any chance?>
	CMsg5_3 <ifChatNPCEasygoing Accept>
	Msg5_4 <Thanks for trying to accept part of the blame, but that still doesn't excuse me. Actually, I called you here today because one of our ex-classmates is in trouble... Do you remember \ELEMENT 4 ?>
	CMsg5_4 <ifChatNPCPassionate Accept>
	Msg5_5 <Well, that doesn't matter much anymore, now that we're both here together finally. I had a reason for calling you today... Do you remember \ELEMENT 4 ? The three of us went to school together.>
	CMsg5_5 <ifChatNPCCheerful Accept>
	Msg5_6 <No, it's my fault, I wanted to write many times... but today, I have a reason for contacting you. Tell me, do you remember \ELEMENT 4 from our school days?>
	CMsg5_6 <ifChatNPCMelancholy Accept>

	Msg6 <I can't say I'm surprised. After graduation we both applied to the academy... but during training \SPR E4 began to change. Soon \SPR E4 dropped out. I kept contact with \OPR E4 for a while. I'm certain \SPR E4 got involved in something bad...>
	Msg6_1 <That doesn't surprise me... not anymore. \ELEMENT 4 joined the academy the same time I did. A year later, something happened to \OPR E4 ... \SPR E4 stopped talking to just about everyone, then dropped out. I'm certain something very bad is going on.>
	CMsg6_1 <ifChatNPCSociable Accept>
	Msg6_2 <That sounds like \OPR E4 ... \SPR E4 has really changed since dropping out of the academy. I suspect that \SPR E4 's in some kind of trouble.>
	CMsg6_2 <ifChatNPCShy Accept>
	Msg6_3 <Is that true!? Then \SPR E4 must be even worse off than I thought... A few years ago \SPR E4 dropped out of the academy. We kept in touch for a while, but there was like a dark shadow growing across \OPR E4 . I'm certain \SPR E4 's in trouble.>
	CMsg6_3 <ifChatNPCEasygoing Accept>
	Msg6_4 <I can't believe that! The \ELEMENT 4 I know could never... of course, \SPR E4 hasn't been \OPR E4 self for a while now. There's something very bad going on. I only wish I knew more...>
	CMsg6_4 <ifChatNPCPassionate Accept>
	Msg6_5 <You're still alive, so I guess \SPR E4 couldn't have wanted to kill you very badly. Last year \SPR E4 dropped out of the academy and got involved in a bad crowd... I don't know exactly what they're up to, but I know it isn't good.>
	CMsg6_5 <ifChatNPCCheerful Accept>
	Msg6_6 <In that case \SPR E4 may already be beyond our help. \ELEMENT 4 quit the academy a year ago... there was something going on, \SPR E4 got involved with some bad people. I don't know all the details but I can tell it's very serious.>
	CMsg6_6 <ifChatNPCMelancholy Accept>

	Msg7 <After graduation both \ELEMENT 4 and I applied to the academy... but during training \SPR E4 began to change. Soon \SPR E4 dropped out. I kept contact with \OPR E4 for a while. I'm certain \SPR E4 got involved in something bad...>
	Msg7_1 <After graduating we both applied to the academy, but a short time later \ELEMENT 4 dropped out. Over the course of basic training \SPR E4 changed.  I kept contact with \OPR E4 for a while. I'm certain \SPR E4 got involved in something bad...>
	CMsg7_1 <ifChatNPCSociable Accept>
	Msg7_2 <\ELEMENT 4 went to the same piloting academy as me, but dropped out of the program suddenly and without explanation. My contact with \OPR E4 suggests that \SPR E4 got involved with some bad people.>
	CMsg7_2 <ifChatNPCShy Accept>
	Msg7_3 <\ELEMENT 4 used to be a good person... that changed after we joined the piloting academy together. I think \SPR E4 was being influenced by someone else... I really don't know what happened...>
	CMsg7_3 <ifChatNPCEasygoing Accept>
	Msg7_4 <\ELEMENT 4 really changed after graduation. After we both joined the academy, \SPR E4 would sometimes disappear for days at a time. Later \SPR E4 dropped out, without reason or explanation.>
	CMsg7_4 <ifChatNPCPassionate Accept>
	Msg7_5 <That's good. You might also remember that \SPR E4 and I both applied to the piloting academy... While there, \ELEMENT 4 changed horribly. It's like \SPR E4 joined a cult or something worse.>
	CMsg7_5 <ifChatNPCCheerful Accept>
	Msg7_6 <I guess \ELEMENT 4 is a hard person to forget... Shortly after we both joined the academy, \SPR E4 cut off all ties to \PPR E4 old friends. It's like \SPR E4 joined a cult. I'm certain something terrible is brewing...>
	CMsg7_6 <ifChatNPCMelancholy Accept>

	Msg8 <I can't say I much care for the person \SPR E4 has become... but for the person \SPR E4 used to be, and for my sake, could you go to \ELEMENT 3 and check up on \OPR E4 ? I have this awful feeling that something terrible is about to happen.>
	Msg8_1 <I would have thought you'd at least be curious as to why \SPR E4 's changed so much... Look, you're better at talking to people than me. Could you go to \ELEMENT 3 and check up on \OPR E4 ?>

	Msg8_2 <That's why you're the best person to ask for this favor... I want someone to go to \ELEMENT 3 , and see what \ELEMENT 4 's up to. I have this awful feeling that something terrible is about to happen.>
	CMsg8_2 <ifG 0 PCRep 3 Accept>
	Msg8_3 <But there's something weird going on, and I'm quite sure you won't let your feelings get in the way of finding out what... The people who've corrupted \ELEMENT 4 are into some bad stuff. Could you go to \ELEMENT 3 and check up on \OPR E4 ?>
	CMsg8_3 <ifG PCRep 4 0 Accept>
	Msg8_4 <This could be more important than just your feelings... The people who've corrupted \ELEMENT 4 are plotting something big. Could you go to \ELEMENT 3 and check up on \OPR E4 ? This could be dangerous to us all.>
	CMsg8_4 <ifG 0 PCRep 4 Accept>
	Msg8_5 <I know, but we were schoolmates after all... You can't just throw that history away. For the friend that \SPR E4 used to be, and for my sake, could you go to \ELEMENT 3 and check up on \OPR E4 ?>
	CMsg8_5 <ifG PCRep 5 0 Accept>
	Msg8_6 <I keep hanging on to this feeling that the old \ELEMENT 4 can still be rescued... That maybe \SPR E4 isn't dead yet. Please, go to \ELEMENT 3 and see if you can talk any sense into \OPR E4 . Do it for me, if for no other reason.>
	CMsg8_6 <ifG 0 PCRep 5 Accept>

	Msg9 <Go to \ELEMENT 3 and talk to \OPR E4 . You know, \SPR E4 used to really look up to you in our school days. That's why \SPR E4 decided to be a pilot. Please do this for me. I have this awful feeling that something terrible is about to happen.>
	Msg9_1 <I recently got an email from \ELEMENT 4 ... \SPR E4 's in \ELEMENT 3 . If you could go there and talk with \OPR E4 , we could find out what's going on...>

	Msg9_2 <I got an email from \OPR E4 recently. There's more going on than \SPR E4 's willing to say. If you go there and speak with \OPR E4 we could find out what's really behind all this.>
	CMsg9_2 <ifChatNPCShy Accept>
	Msg9_3 <Nothing much, just go to \ELEMENT 3 and talk with \OPR E4 . Maybe we can find out what's been going on.>
	CMsg9_3 <ifChatNPCEasygoing Accept>
	Msg9_4 <I've become convinced that \SPR E4 is involved in some huge conspiracy. But, for the friend \SPR E4 once was, I hope \SPR E4 can still be saved... Go to \ELEMENT 3 and seek \OPR E4 out.>
	CMsg9_4 <ifChatNPCPassionate Accept>
	Msg9_5 <I got an email from \OPR E4 ... It kind of sounded like a cry for help. I'd like you to go to \ELEMENT 3 and find out what's happened to \OPR E4 . I'm certain \SPR E4 can still be rescued. I hope so...>
	CMsg9_5 <ifChatNPCCheerful Accept>

	Msg2 <Then you'll be disappointed I'm afraid. I have other things to take care of... My men will handle you by themselves.>

	Msg5_3 <Not today, I'm afraid. I'll have to apologize for leaving early... but my men should be more than sufficient to destroy you themselves.>
	CMsg5_3 <ifChatNPCEasygoing Accept>
	Msg5_4 <Do you really think you're capable of such a feat? I've been given GARU serum by \ELEMENT 6 . My abilities have advanced far beyond the limits of a mere human such as yourself. My men can finish you off themselves...>
	CMsg5_4 <ifChatNPCPassionate Accept>
	Msg5_5 <As much as I'd love to stay and play with you, I'm afraid that I really must be off. My men will be able to defeat you themselves. Try to put up an entertaining fight.>
	CMsg5_5 <ifChatNPCCheerful Accept>
	Msg5_6 <I'm afraid that I don't have time to stay and watch your death... important business calls me elsewhere. Goodbye.>
	CMsg5_6 <ifChatNPCMelancholy Accept>

	Msg6 <I've been taking GARU serum. My abilities have been pumped to beyond human levels... Now, I am far more powerful than you! I no longer have to feel the shame of being second best! When \ELEMENT 6 takes over, I will be a lord!>
	Msg6_1 <They've given me GARU serum... it's boosted my abilities far beyond human levels! They told me that it's completely safe... When \ELEMENT 6 takes over, I will be a lord of the new Earth!>
	CMsg6_1 <ifChatNPCSociable Accept>
	Msg6_2 <You know, training, study, plus some experimental medical procedures... I am moving beyond all limits, transforming into a god!>
	CMsg6_2 <ifChatNPCShy Accept>
	Msg6_3 <I've done nothing but seize the power which always should have been mine... \ELEMENT 6 has provided me with GARU serum. It's increased my abilities a hundred fold!>
	CMsg6_3 <ifChatNPCEasygoing Accept>
	Msg6_4 <Isn't it obvious? I am becoming a god! My benefactors have provided me with GARU serum, the soul of the dragon... I am evolving so quickly... When \ELEMENT 6 immanentizes the eschaton, I will be a lord of the New World Order!>
	CMsg6_4 <ifChatNPCPassionate Accept>
	Msg6_5 <Isn't it wonderful? This is the effect of GARU serum... My body is rebuilding itself on a molecular level. I am becoming a god!>
	CMsg6_5 <ifChatNPCCheerful Accept>
	Msg6_6 <In every battle... there are some sacrifices to be made. My masters in \ELEMENT 6 have provided me with GARU serum. My body is evolving, becoming something else, something better... I have so much power, you can't understand it...>
	CMsg6_6 <ifChatNPCMelancholy Accept>

	Msg7 <That could apply to both of us, couldn't it? Well, my masters have ordered me elsewhere. My men should be able to handle you by themselves. Goodbye, old friend... may your death be more painless than my life has been...>
	Msg7_1 <It's well known that you have precious little humanity left yourself. Don't worry- when you die, I'll have my men recycle you. Goodbye, \PC ...>
	CMsg7_1 <ifChatNPCSociable Accept>
	Msg7_2 <That's a small price to pay for ultimate power. Goodbye, \PC ... my men will prove more than able to destroy you themselves.>
	CMsg7_2 <ifChatNPCShy Accept>
	Msg7_3 <Eh, what did my humanity ever do for me? It's a small thing to trade in exchange for ultimate power.  My men should be able to handle you by themselves. Goodbye, old friend...>
	CMsg7_3 <ifChatNPCEasygoing Accept>
	Msg7_4 <That's right! I'm becoming something far better than a mere human! I would stay here to destroy you, as a demonstration of my godlike abilities, but I must be off... my men can handle you themselves.>
	CMsg7_4 <ifChatNPCPassionate Accept>
	Msg7_5 <Why do you lie? I'm not losing anything, just gaining ultimate power! Goodbye, \PC ... my men should be more than capable of destroying you themselves.>
	CMsg7_5 <ifChatNPCCheerful Accept>
	Msg7_6 <Perhaps I never had any in the first place... In any event it is a far greater thing I will become, than that pitiful creature I once was... Goodbye, \PC . I must be off, but will leave my men to destroy you.>

	Msg8_1 <You're right... soon I will no longer be able to show my face in public, cut off forever from the rest of humanity... But my choice has been made. Even if I wanted to change, there's no going back now, is there?>
	CMsg8_1 <ifChatNPCSociable Accept>
	Msg8_2 <What does it profit one to gain the world, if \SPR E4 loses \PPR E4 soul? But, no... it's too late for me to turn back. There's no other path for me to take.>
	CMsg8_2 <ifChatNPCShy Accept>
	Msg8_3 <If I had any "humanity" I wouldn't have started this process in the first place, would I? But even that doesn't matter any more... The transformation has started and there's no way out for me.>
	CMsg8_3 <ifChatNPCEasygoing Accept>
	Msg8_4 <Don't talk about me as if I'm some kind of loser! I'm powerful now! More powerful than you, even! There's no going back from this point... is there?>

	CMsg8_6 <ifChatNPCMelancholy Accept>

	Msg9 <You've never cared about anyone but yourself, for as long as you've been alive... \ELEMENT 6 has given me exactly what I need. When my men kill you, I'll laugh on your corpse. Goodbye old friend...>
	Msg9_1 <I'm supposed to believe that you suddenly started caring about people just now? I've known you long enough to know that you care only about yourself. Goodbye, \PC .>
	CMsg9_1 <ifChatNPCSociable Accept>

	CMsg9_2 <ifChatNPCShy Accept>
	Msg9_3 <\PC , that crap might work on everyone else but I know you too well. You care about nothing but yourself, and after my men have killed you the world will be better for it. Goodbye.>
	CMsg9_3 <ifChatNPCEasygoing Accept>
	Msg9_4 <I need nothing from anyone, least of all help from an insect like you! I've suffered your insolence for long enough. Now, my men will make short work of you!>
	CMsg9_4 <ifChatNPCPassionate Accept>
	Msg9_5 <Is that supposed to be funny? I don't need help... \ELEMENT 6 has given me everything I've ever wanted, especially the power to destroy you!>
	CMsg9_5 <ifChatNPCCheerful Accept>
	Msg9_6 <There's no help for me, my destiny is sealed... Goodbye \PC . May your death be far less painful than my life has been.>

	Msg10 <What kind of help can you offer me? I am no longer a mere human... there is no way back from where I am now. Can't you see that?>
	Msg10_1 <What kind of help? My transformation has progressed too far... My lust for power has brought me to this place... there is no way back from where I am now. Can't you see that?>
	CMsg10_1 <ifChatNPCSociable Accept>
	Msg10_2 <Can't you see that there's no way you can help me? I'm too far gone...>
	CMsg10_2 <ifChatNPCShy Accept>

	CMsg10_3 <ifChatNPCEasygoing Accept>
	Msg10_4 <You are speaking to a god, worm! There is nothing that can be done for the rage that fills me, except to give it voice in the service of \ELEMENT 6 !>
	CMsg10_4 <ifChatNPCPassionate Accept>
	Msg10_5 <This power \ELEMENT 6 has given me has not brought me peace... but if even this cannot make me happy, what choice do I have?>
	CMsg10_5 <ifChatNPCCheerful Accept>
	Msg10_6 <My transformation has done nothing to silence those demons in my head... my lifelong agony remains... Is there no other path but for me to express this fury against the world!?>

	CMsg11_1 <ifChatNPCSociable Accept>
	Msg11_2 <Enough talking! You're making me confused! I have to go...>
	CMsg11_2 <ifChatNPCShy Accept>

	CMsg11_4 <ifChatNPCPassionate Accept>
	Msg11_5 <At least you're being honest. Up until this point I was actually starting to think you might have something useful to tell me... But no more. Now, my men will destroy you. It's a pity I can't stay around to watch.>
	CMsg11_5 <ifChatNPCCheerful Accept>

	Msg12 <This must be the only thing you're not sure of... I must guess you don't want to speak the truth of your mind. Men, finish him off... I have business elsewhere...>
	Msg12_1 <That's it? No long monologue about how everybody has a spot of goodness in their soul and all? If your intention was to delay my attack you really could have done a better job. If you were honestly trying to convince me, it was even worse...>
	CMsg12_1 <ifChatNPCSociable Accept>
	Msg12_2 <That's all you can come up with? Then it's clear to me now. Men, destroy \PC ... I must be going.>
	CMsg12_2 <ifChatNPCShy Accept>
	Msg12_3 <An honest answer, but hardly convincing. I've wasted enough time here and must be going. My men will see to your execution...>
	CMsg12_3 <ifChatNPCEasygoing Accept>
	Msg12_4 <Pathetic. You can't even think of anything to say... Well, you've prolonged the inevitable for a while, but now it's time for you to die. Men, destroy this loser...>
	CMsg12_4 <ifChatNPCPassionate Accept>
	Msg12_5 <I'd love to stay and chat some more... actually, no, I wouldn't. But I would like to stay and watch my men destroy you... sadly, I must be off. Urgent business awaits.>

	Msg13_1 <I can't believe that... I'd love to stay and chat some more, but you've already wasted enough of my time. I must be off... my men will handle you by themselves.>
	CMsg13_1 <ifChatNPCSociable Accept>
	Msg13_2 <I will think about what you've said. After my men kill you it will make a nice speech to remember you by. Goodbye, \PC .>
	CMsg13_2 <ifChatNPCShy Accept>
	Msg13_3 <You've got a pretty strong belief in human nature. I'm afraid I can't share your convictions... I must be off, but my men will prove more than able to destroy you themselves...>

	Msg14_1 <I can tell just by listening to you that you don't mean it. There's no passion or conviction in your voice. I guess you're just trying to postpone your own death... Well, the time is up. My troops will destroy you now.>
	CMsg14_1 <ifChatNPCSociable Accept>
	Msg14_2 <I have no more time for this. I'm going, but my men will be more than capable of defeating you themselves.>
	CMsg14_2 <ifChatNPCShy Accept>
	Msg14_3 <Even if there was some way, it'd be far too much work. Why would I want to give up my position with the future rulers of the Earth? I have to go, but will leave my troops here to finish you off. Goodbye, \PC .>

		Msg1_1 <I saw on the news there was a big mecha battle near \ELEMENT 3 ... The guardians caught some \ELEMENT 6 pilots trying to escape to \ELEMENT 5 . Did you and \ELEMENT 4 have anything to do with that? What happened? Tell me everything.>

		Msg1_2 <I heard about your fight in \ELEMENT 3 . You might want to know that the survivors from that battle were spotted heading for \ELEMENT 5 . So, I take it \ELEMENT 4 was involved?>
		CMsg1_2 <ifChatNPCShy Accept>
		Msg1_3 <I heard about your fight in \ELEMENT 3 . According to the net, those mecha you destroyed belonged to \ELEMENT 6 , and were operating out of \ELEMENT 5 . I couldn't find anything about \ELEMENT 4 but I'm assuming \SPR E4 was behind it.>
		CMsg1_3 <ifChatNPCEasygoing Accept>
		Msg1_4 <Are you okay? I heard you were ambushed by some \ELEMENT 6 meks! The vidnews said the survivors were caught trying to get to \ELEMENT 5 ... \ELEMENT 4 didn't have anything to do with this, did \SPR E4 ?>

		CMsg2_1 <ifChatNPCSociable Accept>
		Msg2_2 <I should have known. Sorry for getting you involved in this. Um, if you have a few minutes before moving on, there's something else... I've got something to tell you, that I've been holding onto for a long time...>

		Msg2_4 <If I ever see \ELEMENT 4 again, \SPR E4 will not live to regret harming to you. And I'm very sorry for getting you involved. Hey, before you go, I had another reason for calling you... There's something I've wanted to say a long time.>
		CMsg2_4 <ifChatNPCPassionate Accept>
		Msg2_5 <No worries, I knew you could take \OPR E4 . While you're here, \PC , there was another reason why I contacted you... there's something I've wanted to say to you for a long long time...>
		CMsg2_5 <ifChatNPCCheerful Accept>
		Msg2_6 <Don't tell me whether or not you killed \OPR E4 ... I don't want to know. \PC , there was another reason why you were the one I called about this problem... There's something I've needed to tell you, ever since we were in school...>

		CMsg3_3 <ifChatNPCEasygoing Accept>
		Msg3_4 <You'd be surprised... But, from looking in your eyes, I can tell that things didn't go well. Look, before anything else crazy happens, there's something I need to get off my chest... it's something I should have said to you years ago.>
		CMsg3_4 <ifChatNPCPassionate Accept>
		Msg3_5 <Then I won't ask again. The world is going crazy... but before the sky falls, there's something I need to get off my chest. I should have told you this ages ago.>

		CMsg4_3 <ifChatNPCEasygoing Accept>

		CMsg4_4 <ifChatNPCPassionate Accept>
		Msg4_5 <I knew you were the right one to call! But, your skill as a cavalier wasn't the only thing on my mind when I contacted you... there's something I've wanted to tell you for a long time.>
		CMsg4_5 <ifChatNPCCheerful Accept>
		Msg4_6 <Nothing ever works out "all for the best", but I'm glad things didn't end as badly as they could have. Um, if you have a bit of time before you have to go, there's something I've wanted to speak with you about.>
		CMsg4_6 <ifChatNPCMelancholy Accept>

		Msg5 <You're probably right. It was nice seeing you again.>

		CMsg5_1 <ifChatNPCSociable Accept>
		Msg5_2 <Yeah, I understand...>
		CMsg5_2 <ifChatNPCShy Accept>
		Msg5_3 <Okay, it wasn't very important, anyhow...>
		CMsg5_3 <ifChatNPCEasygoing Accept>
		Msg5_4 <I know, I know, but it can be so hard to let go of certain things...>
		CMsg5_4 <ifChatNPCPassionate Accept>
		Msg5_5 <That's good advice... I'll try to remember it. It was very nice seeing you again.>

		Msg1 <You were right. I was following a dark path... I don't want to work for \ELEMENT 6 anymore.>
		Msg1_1 <You were right... I am heading down a dark path... I feel like I am going crazy... I don't want this anymore. I don't want anything.>
		CMsg1_1 <ifChatNPCSociable Accept>
		Msg1_2 <I thought it over. You're right.>
		CMsg1_2 <ifChatNPCShy Accept>
		Msg1_3 <So this is what a nervous breakdown feels like. You were right, \PC , about everything... and I was so wrong. I can't work for \ELEMENT 6 anymore. I'm broken.>
		CMsg1_3 <ifChatNPCEasygoing Accept>
		Msg1_4 <It's not easy for me to admit that you could be right about anything... but I fear you were. I've decided to leave \ELEMENT 6 ... I will find my own path.>
		CMsg1_4 <ifChatNPCPassionate Accept>
		Msg1_5 <I think you could be right... there may still be hope for a demon like me. I was heading for self-destruction, \PC , but you refused to give up on me... I'm just so sorry for all the harm I've caused...>
		CMsg1_5 <ifChatNPCCheerful Accept>
		Msg1_6 <\PC ... your words affected me. I think I may be crazy... or that I was crazy before... but I just can't go on like this. Screw \ELEMENT 6 ... from now on I choose my own path.>
		CMsg1_6 <ifChatNPCMelancholy Accept>
		Msg1_7 <For a long time, I was a servant of the worst evil... I was blinded by jealousy, by ambition... I did some very horrible things. You refused to give up on me, and for that I thank you.>
		CMSg1_7 <ifChatNPCHeroic Accept>

		Msg2 <You convinced \ELEMENT 4 to quit \ELEMENT 6 .>
		Msg3 <I think I've needed help for a long time... You've shown me something I had almost forgotten. I will never be the same as I was, but I can try to start a new life.>
		Msg3_1 <I can't accept any help from you, I've already taken too many things... I know that I won't have a lot of time left once \ELEMENT 6 discovers I've left them. What I can do is tell you what they've been planning...>
		CMsg3_1 <ifChatNPCSociable Accept>
		Msg3_2 <I will. To think of all the things I've done for \ELEMENT 6 ... it's more than I can bear.>
		CMsg3_2 <ifChatNPCShy Accept>
		Msg3_3 <Yeah, if I thought I was going to make it any longer than a week after \ELEMENT 6 finds out I've betrayed them, I'd check myself into therapy right away. Even if it means my death I can no longer take part in their evil plans...>
		CMsg3_3 <ifChatNPCEasygoing Accept>
		Msg3_4 <Are you implying that I've lost my mind? I think you could be right about that, as well... \ELEMENT 6 has to be stopped. I wasn't strong enough to resist their promises...>
		CMsg3_4 <ifChatNPCPassionate Accept>
		Msg3_5 <You really think there could be redemption for someone who's done the things I have? You must be an optimist. I'm not certain of that... but I do know that I cannot remain with \ELEMENT 6 .>
		CMsg3_5 <ifChatNPCCheerful Accept>
		Msg3_6 <No. Either \ELEMENT 6 will find me and kill me for betraying them, or one of the many enemies I made while in their service will find me and do the same.>
		CMsg3_6 <ifChatNPCMelancholy Accept>

		Msg4 <I've decided to quit \ELEMENT 6 ... I can never go back to the way things were, but I can make the most of that time I have left... I feel that without the GARU serum my body is dying... at least I will die a person, not a monster.>
		Msg4_1 <It's \ELEMENT 6 that needs to be punished... If I can give the rest of my life any meaning, it will be through telling the world exactly what they're planning.>
		CMsg4_1 <ifChatNPCSociable Accept>
		Msg4_2 <Don't waste your energy. It's \ELEMENT 6 that you should be concerned about.>
		CMsg4_2 <ifChatNPCShy Accept>
		Msg4_3 <You're probably right. For all the evil things I've done, I no longer deserve to live... but let me tell you this, as bad as I am, \ELEMENT 6 is a hundred times worse.>
		CMsg4_3 <ifChatNPCEasygoing Accept>
		Msg4_4 <All I wanted was to be strong, but \ELEMENT 6 saw my weakness... I acted as their puppet for far too long. Nothing remains but the empty shell of a monster that used to be a human being.>
		CMsg4_4 <ifChatNPCPassionate Accept>
		Msg4_5 <I'll try to avoid that fate for as long as I can, thanks... \ELEMENT 6 knew exactly how to mold me, to make me their puppet. My part in their evil plan will be replaced quite quickly, I'm certain.>
		CMsg4_5 <ifChatNPCCheerful Accept>
		Msg4_6 <Oh, that's going to happen soon enough... Either \ELEMENT 6 will hunt me down for betraying them, or one of the many enemies I've made while in their service will find me first. My only hope now is that I die a human being, not a monster.>
		CMsg4_6 <ifChatNPCMelancholy Accept>

		Msg5 <Control. They want to control everything. And I was so willing to get it for them, so long as they fed my delusions... You were always stronger than me, \PC . It may be up to the people like you to protect this world from them.>
		Msg5_1 <They want the Earth. They've acquired a secret weapon to use against the Federation... But from what I know, I'm not certain they'll be able to control it. We could have the Night of Fire all over again...>
		CMsg5_1 <ifChatNPCSociable Accept>
		Msg5_2 <I never asked. All I wanted was power... their motivations didn't matter to me.>
		CMsg5_2 <ifChatNPCShy Accept>
		Msg5_3 <World domination. They've located an ancient prezero superweapon, and are planning to use it against the Federation. The one good thing is that they don't have all the parts to activate it yet... there's still time to stop them.>
		CMsg5_3 <ifChatNPCEasygoing Accept>
		Msg5_4 <They're bringing about the second apocalypse. Destroy everything, then remake the world in their own image... They're planning to use a doomsday weapon from the age of superpowers. I only hope there's still enough time to stop them.>
		CMsg5_4 <ifChatNPCPassionate Accept>
		Msg5_5 <You know, the usual... world domination mostly. They've got a secret weapon hidden somewhere in the territories. I'm not sure on all the details, I think it may use prezero tech... Anyhow, once they finish it, it'll be bad news.>
		CMsg5_5 <ifChatNPCCheerful Accept>
		Msg5_6 <Power and destruction. They seek to control the Earth, but if they aren't stopped I fear they'll only succeed in destroying it. It's the Age of Superpowers all over again.>
		CMsg5_6 <ifChatNPCMelancholy Accept>

		Msg10 <I've decided to quit \ELEMENT 6 ... but I still can't forgive you for what you've done. I'll be seeing you around, \PC ...>
		Msg10_1 <You'll be pleased to know that your words did, in fact, affect me. I've decided to leave \ELEMENT 6 ... Don't think this makes us friends. I still haven't forgiven you... I never will, until you die...>
		CMsg10_1 <ifChatNPCSociable Accept>
		Msg10_2 <I'm leaving \ELEMENT 6 . I can't take any more of this madness... But I'll still be killing you. See you around, old friend...>
		CMsg10_2 <ifChatNPCShy Accept>
		Msg10_3 <You should know, I've decided to quit \ELEMENT 6 . Some of the things you said made a lot of sense... Mind you, this changes nothing between the two of us. Next time we meet you'll have to fight for your life. Goodbye \PC .>
		CMsg10_3 <ifChatNPCEasygoing Accept>
		Msg10_4 <I can't go on with this... I refuse to let \ELEMENT 6 transform me into a monster! I'm good enough to destroy you even without enhancement... Next time we meet, I'll finally have my revenge!>
		CMsg10_4 <ifChatNPCPassionate Accept>
		Msg10_5 <The stress from working with \ELEMENT 6 was just too much, so I decided to quit... now I can devote myself full time to my true passion, getting revenge against you. Next time we meet I'll definitely end your life. Goodbye \PC .>
		CMsg10_5 <ifChatNPCCheerful Accept>
		Msg10_6 <I can take no more of this madness. I've decided to leave \ELEMENT 6 . Don't think this means our fight is over- if anything, it's only just beginning...>

		CMsg2_6 <ifChatNPCMelancholy Accept>
