	Msg4 <The army's been working on an experimental mecha system. I've found out where the test site is; if you can sneak in there, we can help ourselves to the newest in weapons technology.>
	Msg4_1 <BioCorp has been working on something new. They aren't supposed to do weapon systems, but apparently they have been. I've discovered where the secret lab is. If you can sneak in there, you can sneak out with something very valuable.>
	CMsg4_1 <ifChatNPCSociable Accept>
	Msg4_2 <There's a secret Kettel Industries testing lab where a new mecha is being developed. We have a good chance to steal whatever it is they're working on.>
	CMsg4_2 <ifChatNPCShy Accept>
	Msg4_3 <A lab near town is working on some mecha project for the Navy. If you can slip in there, you can steal the latest in weapons technology. Sounds like it should be an easy job.>
	CMsg4_3 <ifChatNPCEasygoing Accept>
	Msg4_4 <This is a real challenge... but you've proven that you're a skilled thief. An army base near town is home to an experimental new mecha. If you can slip past their guards, it could easily be yours.>
	CMsg4_4 <ifChatNPCPassionate Accept>
	Msg4_5 <Opportunities like this don't come by too often. RegEx corp is developing a new mecha weapon, and I've discovered where they're housing the prototypes! If you can sneak into their complex, all that new technology could be yours.>
	CMsg4_5 <ifChatNPCCheerful Accept>
	Msg4_6 <Kettel Industries has started a new mecha program. They've caused enough bloodshed with their terror weapons, selling them to any dead-zone tyrant who can meet the price. I say we steal the prototype, and put it to better use!>
