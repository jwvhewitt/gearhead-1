	Msg1 <I'm sorry, but the place is a bit of a mess. We were burgalarized last night. May I help you?>
	Msg1_1 <This is terrible! Our hospital has been burgalarized... The thieves broke down the door, and stole the computer containing our patient database. We have backups, but still this is pretty bad...>
	CMsg1_1 <ifChatNPCSociable Accept>
	Msg1_2 <I'm quite busy; our hospital has been broken into. Is there anything I can help you with?>
	CMsg1_2 <ifChatNPCShy Accept>
	Msg1_3 <Hello. May I help you? Don't mind the mess; it's just that our hospital has been broken into.>
	CMsg1_3 <ifChatNPCEasygoing Accept>
	Msg1_4 <Yes, may I help you? I'm very busy... There's been a break-in, our computers were stolen, and I have to make sure that nothing else has gone missing...>
	CMsg1_4 <ifChatNPCPassionate Accept>
	Msg1_5 <Don't panic; yes, our hospital suffered a minor break-in last night, and there's stuff all over the floor, but I assure you everything will be right as rain by tomorrow.>
	CMsg1_5 <ifChatNPCCheerful Accept>
	Msg1_6 <Yes, what is it? As you can see I'm quite busy... We had a break-in last night, everything's all over the place...>
	CMsg1_6 <ifChatNPCMelancholy Accept>

	Msg2 <Not really, but I remember they had a similar incident in Hogye just a short time ago. As far as I know their doctor went missing shortly thereafter.>
	Msg2_1 <It was likely the same people who broke into the Hogye clinic. That happened just a little while ago. Doctor Kim, who works there, hasn't been seen since... \SPR 3 could have been kidnapped or killed.>
	CMsg2_1 <ifChatNPCSociable Accept>
	Msg2_2 <They had a similar incident in Hogye a short time ago; I believe the doctor there was killed. It was probably the same people.>
	CMsg2_2 <ifChatNPCShy Accept>
	Msg2_3 <If I remember correctly there was also a break-in at the Hogye clinic a few days ago. Their doctor also went missing, which makes me glad I wasn't working the night shift yesterday.>
	CMsg2_3 <ifChatNPCEasygoing Accept>
	Msg2_4 <Complete moral degenerates, that's who. The clinic in Hogye was also attacked recently. Their doctor went missing, no doubt a victim of the robbers...>
	CMsg2_4 <ifChatNPCPassionate Accept>
	Msg2_5 <I can't even understand why they'd break in, especially if they weren't going to steal our drugs... In Hogye they had a similar case recently. The doctor who works there went missing.>
	CMsg2_5 <ifChatNPCCheerful Accept>
	Msg2_6 <Who knows? There are all kinds of criminals operating these days... Even in a small town like Hogye. Their clinic was burgularized a short time ago, and their doctor disappeared. He was probably killed by the robbers.>
	CMsg2_6 <ifChatNPCMelancholy Accept>

	Msg3 <I'll see what I can do for you. I hope you don't have any drug allergies, since I can't look up to check...>
	Msg3_1 <Our facilities are largely undamaged; it was just the computers that got stolen. So I should be able to treat your injuries without any complications.>
	CMsg3_1 <ifChatNPCSociable Accept>
	Msg3_2 <Let me take a look at your injuries. I'll do as much as I can.>
	CMsg3_2 <ifChatNPCShy Accept>
	Msg3_3 <Alright. Tell me where it hurts.>
	CMsg3_3 <ifChatNPCEasygoing Accept>
	Msg3_4 <Of course! Let me examine your injuries.>
	CMsg3_4 <ifChatNPCPassionate Accept>
	Msg3_5 <Sure, I can still do that. Tell me where it hurts and I'll make it all better.>
	CMsg3_5 <ifChatNPCCheerful Accept>
	Msg3_6 <I'll see what I can do, but given the state of our facilities I can't make any promises.>
	CMsg3_6 <ifChatNPCMelancholy Accept>

	Msg4 <Keep eating those vegetables.>
	Msg4_1 <Let me know if you experience any side effects. I'll see you again, the next time you get hurt.>
	CMsg4_1 <ifChatNPCSociable Accept>
	Msg4_2 <Take care of yourself.>
	CMsg4_2 <ifChatNPCShy Accept>
	Msg4_3 <If you experience any further problems come back right away.>
	CMsg4_3 <ifChatNPCEasygoing Accept>
	Msg4_4 <Exercise and proper diet are the keys to good health, don't forget that!>
	CMsg4_4 <ifChatNPCPassionate Accept>
	Msg4_5 <That went well.>
	CMsg4_5 <ifChatNPCCheerful Accept>
	Msg4_6 <Try not to get hurt again.>
	CMsg4_6 <ifChatNPCMelancholy Accept>

	Msg5 <Well, somebody certainly should.>
	Msg5_1 <You're from Hogye originally, aren't you? Yes, someone definitely ought to investigate this matter...>
	CMsg5_1 <ifChatNPCSociable Accept>
	Msg5_2 <Well, somebody should.>
	CMsg5_2 <ifChatNPCShy Accept>
	Msg5_3 <I've already told you as much as I know, personally.>
	CMsg5_3 <ifChatNPCEasygoing Accept>
	Msg5_4 <It's terrible that someone could attack a hospital, the center of medical care and charitable work, yet remain at large without punishment... Justice must be done!>
	CMsg5_4 <ifChatNPCPassionate Accept>
	Msg5_5 <If you could get to the bottom of this, I'd certainly applaud your efforts!>
	CMsg5_5 <ifChatNPCCheerful Accept>
	Msg5_6 <I doubt that you'd find out anything... Though if you're determined to try, then go ahead.>

	Prompt2 <I need some healing, quick.>
	Prompt2_1 <Can I still get some healing?>

		Msg2 <About your records: Your blood chemistry is... slightly unusual. No, no, that's wrong... it's completely unusual. You don't have most of the standard protein markers that everyone else does.>
		Msg3 <I have no idea. It means that your genes were modified, somehow, before you were born. It's not a therapeutic modification, but more than that I can't say. I guess that's why the thugs wanted your file. Be careful.>
		Msg4 <No, the guardians are working on it, they haven't turned up anything yet. Whoever was behind it knows a lot about you, though.>

		Msg6 <No idea, but I don't think they were concerned about your health. \NARRATIVE 1 was particularly interested in your birth certificate for some reason. Does that make any sense to you at all? I can't understand it.>
		Msg7 <The thugs who broke in here identified themselves as belonging to \NARRATIVE 2 . I don't know if that's true or not... They wanted anything they could get about your past, medical history, family... anything.>
