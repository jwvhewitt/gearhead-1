	% An NPC will tell the PC to meet him in some other town in
	% some length of time. The PC will then go meet the NPC, at which
	% point in time he must perform some task in order to receive
	% whatever it was that the NPC had promised.

	% As usual, the  difficulcy level of the task should be set by
	% the S103 variable. Examples include waiting until the PC has
	% enough renown, fighting some enemy, retrieving an item from a
	% dungeon, et cetera.

	% Normally, these templates feature plenty of messages which are
	% randomized. This template features just one message for each
	% thing the NPC might want to say. Why? Because a regular combat
	% mission might be encountered dozens of times over the course of
	% a campaign, while this one will likely just be encountered once.

	% E1 is the scene for the current episode.
	% E2 is the character who will tell the PC where to go.
	% E3 is the scene to be used in the next episode.
	% E4 is the scene to be used in the second part of this episode.
