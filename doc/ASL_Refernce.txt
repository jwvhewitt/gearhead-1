0.NOTES

	This is your guide to the Adventure gear, and how things
	work internally in the GearHead RPG campaign. There are three
	datatypes which get used for everything in GearHead- gears,
	Numerical Attributes (abreviated NAtts) and String Attributes
	(abreviated SAtts). You may want to browse through gears.pp
	just to familiarize yourself with these data types before
	going on.

	Commands which are marked as INTERACTION COMMANDs are meant to be
	used in Persona gears only; they will probably cause strange
	results if invoked from a Scene or a Plot.

	Commands which are marked as RPG MODE COMMANDs generally assume
	the existance of a single PC on team one. They may work in
	tactical mode, but may be unpredictable if there's more than one
	player-controlled character.

	This document was written primarily for my own reference. If it
	is of use to anyone else, that's just super.


1.HOW THINGS WORK

	Certain game events place triggers in a list. At the end of
	each game second, if there are any triggers pending, these are
	checked against the scene gear, the plots, and the factions to
	see if there are any events waiting for the triggers placed. If
	an event is found it is then invoked.

	This might make more sense if you take a look at how the adventure
	is put together. This is an overview of the adventure's structure:

*	Adventure Gear
*		Sub
*			Scene Gears
*				Sub
*					Map Features
*						Sub
*							MetaTerrain
*						End
*					Teams
*					Personas
*				Inv
*					NPCs
*					Items
*					Props
*				End
*		Inv
*			Plot Gears (Active)
*				Sub
*					Meta-Personas
*					Plot Gears (Inactive)
*				Inv
*					NPCs to be placed during plot
*					Items to be placed during plot
*				end
*			Dynamic Scene Gears
*				{ Note that dynamic scenes may be defined }
*				{ exactly as regular scene gears, but they get }
*				{ deleted after the player exits them. }
*			Global NPCs
*				{ These NPCs can potentially appear in }
*				{ multiple scenes, as defined by their }
*				{ Locations SAtt. Also, if they are either }
*				{ allies or enemies of the PC, they can }
*				{ possibly appear in Dynamic encounters. }
*			Faction Gears
*				inv
*					Plot Gears (Active)
*					Story Gears (Active)
*						inv
*							Plot Gears (Active)
*						end
*				end
*			Story Gears
*				inv
*					Plot Gears (Active)
*				end
*		end

	When a trigger is set, at the end of the game second, that
	trigger is passed to the scene gear, to all active plots,
	to all active stories, and to all active factions. It is
	therefore quite possible that the same trigger could invoke
	several different events from several different sources.
	Most triggers, though, will probably pass without triggering
	anything.

	The trigger is passed to the scene gear last. So, if there are
	any triggered events in the plots/factions/stories, these will
	be executed first.

	Script events are stored as string attributes in the gears they
	are attached to. The trigger for a given event is the string
	attribute's label.


1.TRIGGERS

	{ Automatically activate interaction with NPC. }
	!TALK [CID]
	This isn't really a trigger- it's one of the new commands for
	the HandleTriggers procedure.
	When this trigger is encountered an interaction with the
	requested NPC is automatically started, if possible.

	{ FROZEN EVENT }
	FRZ[label]
	Similar to the GOTO trigger, this trigger may be used to
	indicate an event which is stored for later use by the COMPOSE
	command.

	{ GET ITEM }
	GET[ID Number]
	This trigger is set when an item which has a narrative ID is
	picked up by the player.

	{ INTERNAL JUMP }
	.[label]
	GO[label]
	This trigger is used to create a line of script which may not
	be directly triggered by game events, but which may be called
	by an ELSE or a GOTO command.

	{ INTERACTION - GREETINGS }
	GREETING
	This line is executed when the conversation starts.

	{ NUMBER OF UNITS CHANGED }
	NU[team]
	This trigger is placed whenever something happens to decrease
	the number of master gears in play on a team.

	{ INTERACTION - MENU EVENTS }
	RESULT[number]
	This event is called when a specific item is chosen from the
	interaction menu.

	{ START OF GAME }
	START
	This trigger is automatically generated at the start of each
	call to PlayScene.

	{ TAKE DOWN }
	TD[uid]
	This trigger is placed when a gear posessing a Unique ID has
	been destroyed. For mecha it is placed when the unit becomes
	nonoperational, so for example it will be placed if the pilot
	is killed or ejects even if the mecha itself is still working.

	{ TEAM MOVEMENT }
	TM[team]
	This trigger is placed whenever a gear belonging to a particular
	team changes map squares. Note that if there's more than one mek
	in this unit, this trigger could be placed several times in rapid
	succession.

	{ NPC ELIMINATED a.k.a. unique takedown }
	UTD[cid]
	This trigger is placed when a gear posessing a Character ID has
	been destroyed.



2.EVENT COMMANDS

	ADDCHAT [number]
	%%% INTERACTION COMMAND %%%
	This procedure will add a new entry to the Interact menu.
	The text for the new entry must be stored as Prompt[number],
	and the event that will be performed when this entry is
	selected is stored as Result[number].

	ADDREACT [value]
	%%% INTERACTION COMMAND %%%
	This procedure will add a positive or negative value to the NPC's
	reaction score.

	ADVANCEPLOT [subplot number]
	This procedure will advance the currently active plot to the listed
	subplot. If the subplot cannot be found, the plot will be removed.
	SubPlots are located in the subcomponents of the current plot; see
	therules.txt for an overview of how an adventure is constructed.
	Each SubPlot is given an ID number when created by the Plot command.
	All sibling subplots should have different ID numbers, but otherwise
	they need not be unique.

	ATTACK [Team1] [Team2]
	This command will cause Team1 to immediately attack Team2.

	CASHPRIZE [value]
	%%% RPG MODE COMMAND %%%
	This procedure will give the PC some money.

	COMPOSE [trigger label] [parameter] [cmd line identifier]
	This procedure may be used to add a new event to the list.
	The trigger for the new event is TRIGGER plus the numeric
	parameter PARAMETER. IDENTIFIER is the trigger of the line
	which is to be used as the event; typically, this will start
	with the "FRZ" tag.

	DELETECHAR [Character ID]
	This procedure will remove a character from the campaign. The ID
	number provided is the CID set by SetPersona. See MDLref.txt.

	DELETEFACTION [Faction ID]
	This procedure will set a faction to inactive status. All
	characters belonging to this faction have their FacID cleared
	and their Renowned reputation reduced by 30. All other gears
	belonging to this faction have their FacID cleared.

	DELETEKEYITEM [Narrative ID]
	This procedure will remove a key item from the campaign. The ID number
	provided is the Narrative ID set by SetKeyItem. See MDLref.txt.

	DYNAMIC [Scale] [Point Value] [NU1 label] [NU2 label]
	This command creates a dynamic encounter. It's like a way to access
	the arena "Enter Combat" control from RPG mode. SCALE is the map
	scale for the encounter; if you're planning a giant robot combat,
	choose 2. (NOTE: At the moment Scale 0 encounters can't be generated)
	Point Value is the number of challenge points that will be used to
	select the enemy mecha. It will be stored as a Numeric Attribute,
	Script Value 0 in the dynamic scene.
	NU1 and NU2 point to frozen script lines (see FRZ, COMPOSE) to be
	inserted in the dynamic scene with triggers NU1 and NU2 (see NU).
	These script lines generally control the exit conditions for the
	dynamic scene.
	The scene ID number for the encounter created will be the same
	as the ID number of the scene from which DYNAMIC was called. Use
	the RETURN command to return to the previous scene.

	E=
	This command sets a value for one of the ELEMENT stats of the
	currently being used plot. Note that this can be a very
	dangerous thing to do!!! You should only modify the value of
	stats that don't have associated game items.

	ENCOUNTER [enemy%] [ally%] [description label]
	This command seeks Global NPCs to add to the current dynamic
	or staged encounter. Enemies are added to Team 2, allies are
	added to Team -1.
	Note that the actual occurence of enemies/allies will probably
	be less than the requested percentage, since the PC might not
	have enough appropriate contacts.
	The description string (indicated by the provided label) should
	contain character description terms (see CHARACTER SEARCH 
	below) and may also contain instructions for the hook to be
	generated. Hook instructions are preceded by a '+'.
	HOOK ITEMS: +ECRA (enemy can run away), +PCRA (player can run away)

	ENDCHAT
	%%% INTERACTION COMMAND %%%
	Ends a conversation by clearing the interaction menu.

	EXIT [code]
	This command will exit the current gameboard or scenario,
	returning [code] to the calling procedure.

	FORCECHAT [CID]
	This command will start a conversation between the PC and
	the specified NPC.

	G= [idnum] [value]
	This command may be used to assign the value of global
	variable IDNUM.

	G+ [idnum] [value]
	This command may be used to add a quantity to the current value
	of global variable IDNUM.

	GOTO [label]
	This command will search for script line LABEL, then invoke
	it.

	IF= [value1] [value2] <ELSE [label]>
	If value1 = value2, continue on with this line. If not,
	jump to LABEL. The LABEL must be formatted as the trigger of
	the line to use next.

	IFFACTION [FID] <else [label]>
	If the requested faction is active, continue on with this line.
	Otherwise branch to the label.

	IFKEYITEM [NID] <ELSE [label]>
	If any of the PC gears currently on the map are in posession of an
	item with the specified Narrative ID, continue on with this line.
	Otherwise branch to the label.

	IFM [mekid] <ELSE [label]>
	If the specified mecha is functional and on the map, continue
	with this line. Otherwise, goto label.

	IFPERSONA [CID] <ELSE [label]>
	If the specified persona can be found and is alive, continue with
	this line. Otherwise, goto label.

	IFYESNO [desc msg] ["yes" msg] ["no" msg] <ELSE [label]>
	This procedure displays a menu, and asks the user to make a choice.
	If the "yes" choice is chosen that's a success, otherwise it's a
	failure. The three parameters refer to MSG strings- see PRINT and
	SAY for more info.
	Note that calling this procedure during a conversation will mess
	up the interaction display. Create conversation menus using the
	NewChat, AddChat, and EndChat commands.

	L= [idnum] [value]
	This command may be used to assign the value of local
	variable IDNUM.

	L+ [idnum] [value]
	This command may be used to add a quantity to the current value
	of local variable IDNUM.

	MDYNAMIC [Scale] [Point Value] [MDesc Label] [NU1 label] [NU2 label]
	Works exactly like the DYNAMIC command, but fills the resultant
	encounter with monsters instead of regular enemies. PV is the
	sum of the monster size ratings. MDesc points to a script line
	which holds the monster descriptions- see the TYPE SAtt below
	for a description of possible monster descriptors.

	MECHAPRIZE [script line label]
	%%% RPG MODE COMMAND %%%
	Team one will be given a shiny new mecha. Yay! The label provided
	should indicate a line which holds the filename of the mecha to load.
	If the specified file has more than one mecha variant in it, one of
	the variants will be chosen at random.
	See the test scene, Hogye Mines L5 for an example of this command.

	MORETEXT [script line label]
	This command will attempt to load the requested file (the filename
	is located in the script line pointed to by the parameter) from
	the Series/ directory, then display the file in the text browser.

	NEWCHAT
	%%% INTERACTION COMMAND %%%
	This command resets the conversation menu with the standard
	options.

	P= [idnum] [value]
	This command may be used to assign the value of plot
	variable IDNUM. Plot variables are those that are located
	inside of PLOT gears.

	P+ [idnum] [value]
	This command may be used to add a quantity to the current value
	of plot variable IDNUM. See notes above.

	PCENEMY [cid]
	The requested NPC will become an enemy of the player character.

	PRINT [idnum]
	This command will print a message in the dialog area.

	REPUTATION [rep num] [value]
	This command affects the reputation of the PC.
	The reputation type index numbers are:
		1:	Heroic (+) / Villainous (-)
		2:	Lawful (+) / Chaotic (-)
		3:	Sociable (+) / Shy (-)
		4:	Easygoing (+) / Passionate (-)
		5:	Cheerful (+) / Melancholy (-)
		6:	Renowned (+) / Wangtta (-)
		7:	Pragmatic (+) / Spiritual (-)
	Use a positive value to improve the (+) reputation, or a negative
	value to improve the (-) reputation.

	RETREAT [team ID]
	When this command is invoked, all the functioning masters
	belonging to the listed team are removed from the map. A
	Number Of Units trigger is then set.

	RETURN
	This functions like EXIT, but the return code is equal to the
	ID number of the current scene.

	RUNAWAY [CID]
	When this command is invoked, the character with the requested
	CID is sought on the game board, then removed from the map.
	A NU trigger is then set.

	SAVEPOS
	%%% RPG MODE COMMAND %%%
	This command will record the current location of the PC in the
	scene gear. If there's more than one master on team one at the
	moment, it'll save the position of one of them. The next time this
	scene is entered, the first team one master deployed on the map
	will appear at the saved coordinates.

	SAY [idnum]
	%%% INTERACTION COMMAND %%%
	This command will print a message in the interaction message
	area.

	SAYANYTHING
	%%% INTERACTION COMMAND %%%
	This command will print a random, though potentially useful,
	message in the interaction message area.

	SCHOOL [skill list identifier]
	%%% INTERACTION COMMAND %%%
	This command lets the NPC teach the PC some things about skills.
	It passes the provided line on to the OpenSchool procedure, or
	an empty line if the requested one can't be found. The line should
	contain a list of the skill indicies that the NPC can teach
	(separated by spaces, as usual). See doc/character.txt for a list
	of the indicies for each skill.

	SEEKTERR [terrain type]
	%%% RPG MODE COMMAND %%%
	This command will assign a value to SCRIPT_Terrain_To_Seek.
	When the player moves to a new level, his or her starting position
	will try to match the terrain specified.

	SETPLAYERFACTION [faction ID]
	%%% RPG MODE COMMAND %%%
	This command will set the player's FACTION value, both in the
	PC character record and also in the root ADVENTURE record.

	SETSCENEFACTION [scene ID] [faction ID]
	This command will change the Faction ID of a given scene to the
	provided value. It will perform the following additional operations
	upon the affected scene: 1) Move all members of other factions
	to different scenes; 2) Insert in scene three random pilots
	belonging to the new faction.

	SHOP [wares identifier]
	%%% INTERACTION COMMAND %%%
	This command passes the provided line on to the OpenShop
	procedure. If the line cannot be found, this command passes
	a blank string instead.
	The Wares line should contain a list of gear "G"eneral
	descriptors which will be used to construct the list of
	items for sale.
	The MECHA command may be added to the wares string. This will
	add some meks to the shopping list, and allow the player to sell
	mecha to this shopkeeper.
	The MEXTRA command may be added to the wares string. This will
	add some mecha-scale equipment to the wares list.

	STAGED [Label] [Point Value]
	This procedure works like DYNAMIC. It creates a dynaic encounter
	and stocks it with mecha. Unlike DYNAMIC, this procedure loads
	the scene from disk. The filename should be in a line pointed to
	by LABEL; it may contain wildcards.

	STORYLINE [script line label] <ELSE [label]>
	This command forcibly inserts a plot script into an adventure.
	If for some reason the plot cannot be inserted- either because
	the requested file is not found or because not all of the
	plot elements can be initialized- the ELSE clause is executed.

	TIME [delay]
	This causes the game clock to advance by the specified amount.

	TORD [team] [order <parameters>]
	This command allows you to issue orders to an entire team at
	once. The parameter ORDER is a label which describes the order
	to be issued; some orders require additional parameters.
		ASS:	Assassinate [target ID]
		GO:	Goto Spot [X] [Y]
		SD:	SeekAndDestroy
		PASS:	Passive
	The default actions of this procedure are as follows: If the
	order has one parameter, it's assumed to be a mek UID and stored
	in ATarget unless otherwise controlled. If it has two parameters,
	they are assumed to be map coordinates and are stored in GX,GY
	unless otherwise controlled. If the parameters are to be treated
	otherwise a special case must be added to 'arenascript.pp'.

	TREPUTATION [team number] [rep num] [value]
	This functions exactly like the REPUTATION command, but it
	affects a team other than the player team.

	V= [idnum] [value]
	This command may be used to assign the value of variable IDNUM.

	V+ [idnum] [value]
	This command may be used to add a quantity to the current value
	of variable IDNUM.

	XPV [experience award]
	%%% RPG MODE COMMAND %%%
	Gives a number of free experience points to the PC.

3.MISCELLANEOUS

	?M[team number]
	?P[team number]
	This function will return the Unique ID of a random (M)echa
	or (P)ilot from the specified team. If no active members of
	the team are found, this function returns 0.

	@[gear ID]
	This function will return the ID number of the root gear for
	the gear pointed to by the ID.

	COMTIME
	This variable returns the current combat time, as stored in the
	game board.

	D[Die Size]
	This returns a random number between 1 and the value provided. The
	die size must be a positive integer.

	E[idnum]

	This returns the number of NPCs belonging to this faction.

	FacScene [idnum]
	This returns the number of scenes controlled by the listed
	faction.

	value. Global variables are those which are stored in the root
	adventure gear.

	HOSTILEFACTIONS
	This function returns the number of hostile factions currently
	active in the adventure world. A faction is listed as hostile if
	it has the MILITARY type, and also if it has any active, MILITARY
	enemies.

	L[idnum]
	This allows a "local" variable to be used instead of a constant
	value. "Local" variables are stored in the GameBoard/Scenario
	gear; if the event source is the scenario itself, using L[idnum]
	is equivalent to using V[idnum].

	LOOKER[X]%[Y]
	This SAtt can be included in a scene to give a map tile a
	special description when viewed.

	MSG[idnum] <[Text Message Here.]>
	Game messages are stored as string attributes in the same place
	as the events.

	NPCREP [CID] [idnum]
	This expression returns the value of one of the requested
	NPC's reputations.

	P[idnum]
	This expression allows the value of variable [idnum] to be
	used in a procedure, rather than a constant. Variables accessed
	in this way are stored in the currently active PLOT gear.

	PCFAC
	This function returns the ID number of the PC's faction. If the
	PC does not belong to any faction, it will return 0.

	PCMEKS
	This expression returns the number of mecha on team 1,
	whether they are currently on the map or off of it. Useful for
	deciding whether or not the PC can take part in mecha missions,
	or for deciding whether or not a generous NPC will give the PC
	a new mecha...

	PCREP [idnum]
	%%% INTERACTION COMMAND %%%
	This expression returns the value of one of the PC's reputations.

	PCSCALE
	%%% RPG MODE COMMAND %%%

	it will be 0 if the PC is on foot, or greater if the PC is in a
	mecha.

	PROMPT[idnum] <[Text Message Here.]>
	%%% INTERACTION COMMAND %%%
	The text for interaction menu items is stored here.

	REACT
	%%% INTERACTION COMMAND %%%
	This variable returns the value of I_Reaction.

	REWARD [threat value] [percent]
	This command returns the standard reward value for a combat
	mission of the listed threat value. Percent may be used to
	alter the reward gained based upon such factors as whether or
	not the player got salvage, etc.

	SCENEFACTION [scene ID]
	This function returns the faction for the requested scene.
	If the scene cannot be found, or has no faction assigned,
	this function returns zero.

	SCENEID
	This variable returns GB^.Scene^.S, which should be the
	unique ID for this particular location.

	SKROLL [Skill Number]
	%%% RPG MODE COMMAND %%%
	This function returns the result of a player character skill roll.

	T[team number]
	This variable returns the number of operational masters on the
	provided team.

	THREAT [Reputation] [Percent]
	This function returns a threat value appropriate for a character
	with the given reputation. Normally scenarios will choose a threat
	value of Rep + d30 or so, allowing for some variety. The percent
	scales the value before it is returned, so that an easy or difficult
	encounter can be generated for the threat value provided.

	V[idnum]
	This expression allows the value of variable [idnum] to be
	used in a procedure, rather than a constant. Variables accessed
	in this way are stored in whatever the current Source gear is.

4.MESSAGE FORMATTING COMMANDS

	\ELEMENT [idnum]
	This formatting command inserts the name of the plot element referred
	to. If called from outside of a plot, this could print garbage.

5.OTHER STRING ATTRIBUTES OF NOTE

	ELEMENT1 ... ELEMENT8
	When defining a PLOT gear, up to 8 elements may be associated with it.
	The first word in the element description should refer to what
	kind of element this is- see below for the choices available.
	The other words in the element description are traits that must
	belong to the gear which is selected when the plot is invoked.
(
	CHARACTER: See Character Search below for information.

	SCENE: Dungeon, Town, Scale[n]

	ITEM: Currently items cannot be sought, but may be Prefab.

	FACTION: Military, Corporate, ATWar, AtPeace

	GRAB: [n]  - Grabs element from parent story

	PREFAB: Prefabricated Element. The element is not sought from the
	adventure, but is instead taken from the INV components of the plot.
	The first PREFAB element will draw the first item from INV, the next
	the second item, and so on.
)

	EVENT
	Placed in a GATE gear. This SATT overrides the default script
	set by the RMG when this gate is entered. See "Hogye Mines L5"
	for an example of this SATT in use.

	FITS
	Placed in an EXARMOR gear. This SAtt describes what sort of
	masters can wear the armor. Characters get the same descriptors
	as listed above under ELEMENT. Mecha get only their form name.

	HOME
	This SAtt contains the name of one of the map features. If a character
	has this string attribute, they will try to be deployed somewhere within
	the requested map feature, if it can be found.

	LOCATIONS
	When placed in a NPC, this SATT indicates that the NPC is global.
	It contains a list of all the scenes which the NPC can move to.

	PLACE
	This string determines where a PREFAB element will be placed.
	The first word in a PLACE string must be the number of the
	previous element with which to associate this one.
	The remaining words may contain instructions for the placement
	procedure; in the case of a character, this will be the TEAMDATA
	information. See that SATT description below.
	This string attribute is placed in the root gear of the
	prefab element.

	RUMOR <Rumor Text>
	This SAtt can be placed in a number of different gears. It
	provides a rumor which may come up while the player is chatting
	with an NPC.
	PLOT RUMORS: ![n] is replaced with the name of the listed
	element.

	TEAMDATA <Team Description>
	This string attribute should belong to a NPC. It provides 
	information about what sort of team the NPC ought to be a
	member of.
	COMMANDS: enemy, ally, wmon, Command names (see TORD cmd)

	TYPE <Monster descriptions>
	When this string element is assigned to a Team that has its
	random encounter value set, it determines what kind of monsters
	will be placed when random monsters are generated.
	When this string element is assigned to a monster, it determines
	if that critter will be selected by any particular random
	encounter generator, and also may determine the monster's
	weaknesses against slaying-weapons and the like.
	When this string is associated with a weapon, it stores the
	attack attributes.
	When this string attribute is associated with a faction, scene,
	or just about anything else, it is used to pick a random thing
	by plots and stories.

6.CHARACTER SEARCH

	This was initially filed under ELEMENT above, but it has
	become a more general utility so I've moved it here.

	CHARACTER: Gender:M, Gender:F, Gender:N, Gender:U,
    Young, Old, Heroic, Villainous, Lawful,
	Chaotic, Sociable, Shy, Easygoing, Passionate, Cheerful, Melancholy,
	Reflexes, Body, Speed, Perception, Craft, Ego, Knowledge, Charm,
	Job Description (see ANPCdefault.txt),
	ArchEnemy, ArchAlly, Family, Lover, HasMecha, YesPlot, NoPlot

	Descriptions starting with ! are relative elements.
	These don't describe intrinsic properties of the NPC itself,
	but instead relations between the NPC and other things.

	!C [plot element index]
	Comrade command. This element must belong to the same faction
	as the requested element.

	!E [plot element index]
	This element must belong to a faction which is the enemy of
	the faction to which the requested element belongs. Clear
	as mud.

	!F [plot element index]
	Far, must be in different scene from listed element. This
	is only meaningful if the character search is happening from
	a plot.

	!G
	Global, allows possibility to select global NPCs.

	!LanceMate (exclusive tag; lancemates won't be selected without it)
	Allows possibility to select lancemates. If a lancemate is requested,
	then only lancemates may be chosen.

	!M [Faction ID]
	The element must belong to the requested faction. Useful for
	making sure that a selected element has no faction affiliation.

	!N [plot element index]
	Near, must be in same scene as listed element. This
	is only meaningful if the character search is happening from
	a plot.

	!X [plot element index]

	element. This is only meaningful if the character search is
	happening from a plot.
